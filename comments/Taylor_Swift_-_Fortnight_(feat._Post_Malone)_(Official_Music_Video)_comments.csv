i love the aesthetic  and the concept of this song! i feel like this song captures the darkness within oneself that arises on having to face one's treason from someone you loved deeply and seeing your future shattered by that very same person to choose it to pursue with someone else that it kind of drives one towards the edge of insanity.,@ayanoyamada2051,2024-12-17T18:26:32Z

I Love everything The distant echoes in the song and the Nostalgic Victorian  in black and white film noir era vs a touch of color male vs female. Although the video has A Dark Esthetic Feel to it but it still is romantically beautiful at the same time as well as the chemistry between them. I simply cannot not stop listening to this song and I can’t stop watching this Video. I am definitely A matured Taylor Swift Fan now. I Love History so therefore I love classic Music & Classic Movies (Film Noir) & I love ❤the Victorian Era. This song although dark is also sensuously sensitive as well!!! I Love It All!!!!,@shonnajennings2304,2024-09-28T21:32:43Z

"Does anybody remember 10-14 years ago when Taylor Swift wrote those great hits, music, albums and songs? Her recent success and popularity of “Midnights” and “The Tortured Poets Department” have been based off of popularity. Not talent, and talent will one day catch up to her.

This is one of Taylor's most beautiful, mature songs and Post Malone harmonizes and fits in with it effortlessly.

"Am I the only one hearing lyrics something like ""It's *Ru-H-ining* my life"" very similar to Stewie off Family Guy? Fyi I didn't read all the comments, I started to but nahhhh too many lol, but seriously did anyone else notice this that is willing to respond to my possibly after comment?!?!?! Love this song even more if either or both were making that reference ❤️👏🏽🤣",@Debbie-i9k,2024-07-01T04:44:50Z

This is the best song I have listened to in years! And 2024 has been a year of many new releases but this has TTPD beat in a longshot for such vocal and emotional honesty in a wonderful performance of a gut wrenching song. This is music. This is a greatness at its finest.,@TheVinteej,2024-06-30T19:47:13Z
This collaboration is absolutely amazing! Taylor Swift and Post Malone together create such a unique and powerful blend of their styles. The visuals and the music are truly captivating. Great job! 🎶🔥,@LakeViewChillLyrics,2024-06-29T15:54:56Z

Eu me apaixonei por vc, vc me fez acreditar que tudo seria possível. Nunca senti algo tao intenso quanto senti por vc, vc donimou a minha mente e se foi da maneira mais cruel que alguem poderia sair da vida alguem sabendo dos sentimentos dela. Se um dia ver essa mensagem, não me liga por eu tenho certeza de ainda vai estar doendo e eu não posso ver vc partindo novamente. Eu te amo❤ vc sempre vai ser aquilo que eu queria viver 😢😢",@thaisteixeira6492,2024-08-31T06:27:52Z

Unpopular opinion/take... i don't know why but I get Beyoncé and Jay Z vibes. Like relationship wise I mean.

"I am a 23 year old man from South Sudan, I have spent most of my life in a continuous war, it was a normal day 2 weeks ago as I was fighting. Then, the Sudanese fighters played this absolute masterpiece, we then began to all put down our guns and dance to this lyrical masterpiece. Thank you, sir. For Peace this song changed my life. My entire view of everything that exists in this world, in fact, even in the entire universe. I can never look at anything I know the same way again. This song represents emotions that most humans could never understand. But I can. Thanks to this song I was awakened to many things previously considered unimaginable. Thank you for this exquisite song. This video is an exquisite masterpiece, out of every single video I have ever even heard of on the entire platform, this by far has enlightened me to do fly, lose 90 pounds and even become the president of the United States, and I'm going to tell you why this is such a masterpiece as if hearing the creators, no, god of this universes luscious voice. I would like to express my thanks to you. My gratitude for your indisputably magnificent assistance is almost infinite. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed. I really like your contribution that you have in our society, you really make a difference and help others out, the world could always use more people like you. Gosh, what a polite and humble fellow. It is such a kind honor for someone as low as me to be in contact with someone of a level such as yours. I thank you once again my good friend. A world without you, would be a world I would not be able to live in, and I believe I share that opinion with most people. I can rest easy tonight knowing you helped. I appreciate you and everything you stand for and on behalf of everyone on planet earth, thanks. Yes I 100% agree no lie I am 10/10 with you in this statement no question. You are completely absolutely correct and have made no mistake in your sentence whatsoever and I applaud you for that as you have made a thoughtful statement that many agree with and those that disagree are in the minority because your statement has absolutely no faults and thus is completely without a question correct and deserves nothing but agreement. and by the way, super saiyan blue theme is a very powerful, moving song that showcased the capabilities of human emotion. It used groundbreaking technology to create stunning sounds that would mesmerize the listeners. This song is suitable for all ages; whether you're 5 years old, or 50, you should listen to this song. It is inspiring and it showcases the spectrum of human nature and how humans communicate with each other. This song revolutionized the music industry and set the bar high for other songs. In the future historians will look back on this song and regard it as the pinnacle of human achievement. It was a roller-coaster from start to finish, the nail-biting song will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Listeners will find themselves absorbed by the heartwarming tale of a relentless, determined African tribes who didn't let societies standards shape his/her/it's life. I was shocked by how intense and gripping this song was. The plot is rich, unpredictable and touching. This isn't your typical African war song, this song is a war with one's emotions. Tales of Africa is a stirring masterpiece that only comes once in a millennium. This thrilling instruments makes it a jaw-dropping performance that properly utilizes the medium. I rate this song 10 African tribes/10 African tribes, and will never listen to it again as every time I get saddened by the the fact that there will never be a song to match this masterpiece.",@enchantedchat1237,2023-11-14T05:04:02Z

"I fell for him when I was in 8th grade.. we met again sophmore year.. I fell harder for him or at least from my perspective I did. Covid hit us during 8th grade.. me and him mutually had feelings but kept quite we are different enthicity although it didn’t matter I knew my parents wouldn’t agree for us I still had so much feelings for him. So here I was sophmore year back from Covid and done with hybrid. We didn’t go to the same Highschool he played on his schools team basketball. I finally decided to go and watch a basketball tournament. There I was on the bleachers on my phone but heard one of my old friends say that they see him. I remember thinking “Omgg is it really him?” And then texted him on insta after searching and I went up to say hi to him. Later on that day we started to text on and on and feelings just grew again. I tried to feel nothing and just be friends but his smiles and eyes just mesmerized me. Green and pretty as a lake cute and funny smile. I started going to his basketball games more after and would tell my parents that I needed to work at the basketball games. We talked for a month and expressed how we each felt. But he had a girl bsf who was lesbian. So I thought nothing of it but she’d never really talk to me. I asked my parents if it was okay if I dated someone out of my race and bc my parents were strict I told him that I was scared that one day he would give up. He made me feel so magical or for at least for a sophmore who never felt love like that. He was gonna bring me flowers and ask me to be his gf but I told him no flowers my parents would kill me. Weeks go by my parents got even more scary so I had to tell him that I.. I couldn’t be with him.. and that we should just stay as friends. I broke his heart but he also broke mines… he agreed and it hurt so much for me bc deep down I didn’t want to.. I started going a little crazy. Crying every day and night texting him, seeing him everywhere, day dreaming of him sitting next to me in class, hearing his voice and smelling his scent. Then later someone threatened him and he finally texted me but just to blame me for it when I never would.. and it hurt. I knew he was over me already and I felt so empty or I felt empty. 2 months go by I check on him through his friend his friend told me his perfectly fine as I tortured my soul every night thinking he was as hurt as me… 2 months since we broke apart he started dating his girl bsf I’m not exactly sure when they even started talking or dating. I went to check his tik tok and he finally unblocked me, I checked his profile picture and it was a video of them making out. My heart broke to millions of pieces.. she was wearing the sweater I wore and gave back. Those next 5 months felt like forever but I slowly stopped checking and he apologized but I didn’t want to forgive but now I do bc I used to love him and there was always gonna be the good times and the bad times helped me move on.",@royaltylily4103,2023-04-05T17:44:54Z

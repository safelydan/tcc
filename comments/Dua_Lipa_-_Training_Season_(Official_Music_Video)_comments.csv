"🤔😐Do you know what the most important thing in the world is🌎🌍 to do? It's not making money,💰💰 it's not eating,🎂🍰 or drinking,🍷🍾 much less playing games.♠♣♟ We came into this world with nothing, and we will leave it with nothing. Here everything is temporary, but on the other side everything is eternal. So the most important thing is to follow God, read the Bible, attend an evangelical church and prepare yourself for that day that you don't know when it will come; otherwise, you will descend with the other👺 into a suffering that will never end.😰😭😫",,2025-02-28T23:50:07Z

And it is so much fun to dance. I want you to teach me how to dance to count someday. ... If you ever see a Elton John again, if he tells you he is straight, then be nice to him. If he tells you he's gay, then tell him to leave you alone. If he doesn't leave you alone, then beat the living hell out of him. ..... Dua Lipa, nobody hits high pitch vocals like do. Not even close. How do you do that? It is so amazing. Those high pitches you hit feel so good on my ears. I can't wait for you to explain to me how you get your voice to do that. You are the only one who does that.

Der Schöpfer wird über den usurpierten Thron der Sterne richten!!!  因为人类的邪恶，因为黑暗的隐秘暴虐，雨总会为失落的男男女女的心灵流下深沉而压抑的泪水！ 月亮总会吟诵一首照亮黑夜的诗！！！ 卡梅莉亚·卡西奥佩娅并不是希腊神话中的女神；她是希腊神话中的女神。 但当代文学之美！ 造物主将审判篡夺的星辰王座！！！ JJJSSS",@danieloliveira-vz2wp,2024-04-04T00:45:52Z

"The autumn equinox painting, the yellow waltz preamble of the season trees, is an emotional psychological theatrical scenario of the composition of the colors displayed on the heavenly wall; the sincere gray is amalgam  with the light of afterglow, in the shades of all the perpetives of the firmament !!!  The vision of the mermaid took place on the blue stone of the sea, and under the great mouth of the moon, which sang in the tuning fork of the watery world of whales and dolphins; capturing the senses of sailors and fishermen; and waking up the deep sleep of the rocks in the infinity of oceanic thoughts!!!  A  pintura do equinócio outonal, o preâmbulo da valsa amarela das árvores da estação,  é um cenário teatral psicológico emocional da composição das cores exibidas na parede celestial;  o cinzento sincero se amálgama com a luz do arrebol, nos tons de todas as perpectivas do firmamento!!! A visão da sereia aconteceu sobre a pedra azul do mar, e sob a grande boca da lua, que cantava no diapasão do mundo aquático das baleias e golfinhos; capturando os sentidos dos marinheiros e pescadores; e acordando o sono profundo dos rochedos no infinito dos pensamentos oceanicos!!!  La peinture de l'équinoxe d'automne, préambule de la valse jaune des arbres de saison, est un scénario théâtral psychologique émotionnel de la composition des couleurs affichées sur le mur céleste ; le gris sincère s'amalgame avec la lumière de la rémanence, dans les nuances de tous les perpétifs du firmament !!! La vision de la sirène a eu lieu sur la pierre bleue de la mer, et sous la grande bouche de la lune, qui chantait dans le diapason du monde aquatique des baleines et des dauphins ; capturer les sens des marins et des pêcheurs ; et réveiller le sommeil profond des roches dans l'infinité des pensées océaniques !!! La pintura del equinoccio de otoño, el vals amarillo preámbulo de los árboles de temporada, es un escenario teatral psicológico emocional de la composición de los colores que se muestran en la pared celestial; ¡¡¡El gris sincero es amalgama con la luz del resplandor, en las sombras de todas las perpetivas del firmamento !!! La visión de la sirena tuvo lugar sobre la piedra azul del mar, y bajo la gran boca de la luna, que cantaba en el diapasón del mundo acuático de las ballenas y los delfines; capturando los sentidos de marineros y pescadores; y despertando  el sueño profundo de las rocas en la infinidad de pensamientos oceánicos!!! Il dipinto dell'equinozio d'autunno, il preambolo del valzer giallo degli alberi della stagione, è uno scenario teatrale psicologico emotivo della composizione dei colori esposti sulla parete celeste; il grigio sincero si amalgama con la luce degli ultimi bagliori, nelle sfumature di tutti i perpetui del firmamento!!! La visione della sirena ebbe luogo sulla pietra azzurra del mare, e sotto la grande bocca della luna, che cantava nel diapason del mondo acquatico delle balene e dei delfini; catturare i sensi di marinai e pescatori; e svegliarsi  il sonno profondo degli scogli nell'infinito dei pensieri oceanici!!! Das Herbst-Tagundnachtgleiche-Gemälde, die gelbe Walzer-Einleitung der Jahreszeitenbäume, ist ein emotional-psychologisches Theaterszenario der Komposition der Farben, die an der himmlischen Wand angezeigt werden; Das aufrichtige Grau verschmilzt mit dem Licht des Nachglühens, in den Schattierungen aller Perpetiven des Firmaments !!! Die Vision der Meerjungfrau fand auf dem blauen Stein des Meeres und unter dem großen Mund des Mondes statt, der in der Stimmgabel der Wasserwelt der Wale und Delfine sang; Entführung der Sinne von Seeleuten und Fischern;; Den tiefen Schlaf der Felsen erwachen lassen, in der Unendlichkeit ozeanischer Gedanken; am unendlichen Grund der Ozeane!!!

"Dua Lipa has such a beautiful strong voice.  Love her richness on her low, high and falsetto notes",@LaughterandJesus,2024-02-19T03:20:49Z
"I love the song, but the video feels awfully intimidating. I was scared the whole time that they'd grab her.",@suvijii841,2024-02-18T22:16:12Z
besides the music...lyrics are actually relatable in some context like woah,@cemc9005,2024-02-18T21:16:35Z

Vibe is ❤️‍🔥,@s.i.n2375,2024-02-18T19:26:01Z
This era’s singles are so good when you don’t have some annoying white twink saying all her new music sounds like Future Nostalgia,@jlo2715,2024-02-18T18:53:56Z
Giving a Monica Bellucci from Malena vibes,@Gigixoxo123,2024-02-18T18:24:06Z

Really like Dua but this is mediocre at best - 17th at Eurovision vibes. Very forgettable.,@kieranstewart78,2024-02-18T11:57:04Z

Everyone song of her give different vibes ❤,@ankurdas4608,2024-02-18T04:57:05Z
Ironically  the song sounds like a whirlpool. Musically and visually everything begins to spin and then stops in the chorus. What makes you feel like VERTIGO.🌪🌀🌀🌀,@raymundogimenez2941,2024-02-18T03:49:38Z
Her voice is infallible but the song sucks. Houdini sucks too. Too often the lyrics of her songs are cringy.,@thalia6731,2024-02-18T03:41:04Z
"it has ""i was gonna cancel"" by Kylie Minogue vibes",@ldmrod27,2024-02-18T02:19:55Z
Wasn't sure about this song the first time i listened just because its got very different chords and structure than most pop but after a few listens i really like it just for that reason.,@briancrawford69,2024-02-18T01:09:27Z
So catchy,@esc19,2024-02-18T00:51:22Z

Great song by Tame Impala with featured vocals of Dua Lipa 👌🫡,@thisismk1,2024-02-17T21:43:59Z
Amazing song. A little weird hearing her using high pitch but sounds amazing anyways. Saludos from Argentina DUA!,@themarushin,2024-02-17T21:37:16Z
the chorus sounds EXACTLY like “Tokyo nights” by Digital Farm Animals what even,@TyH-h6q,2024-02-17T21:08:10Z
The chorus EASILY could have been an ABBA song.,@justafidemyself,2024-02-17T21:05:25Z

Stylish vibe w/ sweet musical flare as one can always expect from the master that is Dua Lipa!,@DorothyOzmaLover,2024-02-17T13:52:51Z
The lyrics are like my thoughts. How'd that happen? 💯♥️,@EnjoyingLife2025AD,2024-02-17T13:04:44Z
too much autotune this is amazing but over usage is not great her natural voice is way better,@HadoushGaming,2024-02-17T12:28:45Z
Dua said its bye to nonchalant emotionally unavailable men cuz theyre not competing with other men anymore but a womans inner peace with themselves,@GuyunZhongli-ow4ti,2024-02-17T12:07:04Z
I STILL WONDER....WHY DO THEY SAY EVERY DETAIL OF THE VIDEO CLIP IN THE COMMENTS BELOW EVEN THE NAIL ARTIST AND IT DOES NOT SAY WHO WROTE THE MUSIC AND THE LYRICS OF THE SONG?  WHY THIS DISDAIN TO THE ARTISTS?,@Iliasmakridis,2024-02-17T10:43:11Z
This gives super bowls halftime show vibe💜,@jafaralikhan3525,2024-02-17T10:05:04Z

"Dua lost her mojo. Dance the night, Houdini and now Training Session are the same. So generic and boring.",@Venkman990,2024-02-17T09:02:25Z
I feel I want to be with her when she’s creating the lyrics. Such a powerful song,@mohammadarif6404,2024-02-17T08:48:02Z
"This lady is pure fire 🔥 She definitely has that 80s pop vibe and I must say , her video for this song was so creative. I wish her more future success. She deserves more air play on the radio.👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🙂",@PlayitagainVHS,2024-02-17T08:38:38Z
"The best pop song of 2024 is ""Dua Lipa - Training Season."" I really like it. As usual, the beat is excellently produced, and the vocals are superb. The previous single, ""Houdini,"" underrated by many, I find very appealing for how it mysteriously unfolds from the beginning and gradually intensifies. The music flows naturally, it's wonderful music. I love it ♥",@BassFunMusic,2024-02-17T08:06:42Z
the ( challenge) tone in 3:04 is glamorous.,@walidbennouba8532,2024-02-17T07:37:17Z

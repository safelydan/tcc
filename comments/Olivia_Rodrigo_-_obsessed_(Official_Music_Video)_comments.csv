"โค rad. Vocals sounding great. Still a total beauty, even more so. Song content still with lots of raw unapologetic moxy :) Still a cool band, perhaps even cooler in fact, an epic drummer, and now with a very lucky guitar player (was he always in the band?) How lucky is the guy playing the jazzmaster guitar with a group of beautiful rad musicians :) I envy him :) in any case, with a handful of years passing, and everyone aging and evolving, I'm glad I get to have a listen / look to what you are doing, without feeling like an old lecher, even though I still feel like an aged out 1000 year old vampire at times, but the reality is that I'm more of a dr frankenstein's monster than dracula anyway, even though I'm not sure that that is better tho :)",@audioeins,2025-03-19T15:03:45Z

"R u saying that based on the fact that ur ancestors made slaves of the tribesmen that ur kids deserve to be bullied to the point of wanting to kill others or thier families so that u get to enjoy the riches life has to offer. Is that okay for all kids because there is many cases of little kids being force fed thier own feces or sex trafficked just so u can continue to not control ur emotions and bully only ur family. What about the kids that where enslaved to ur ancestors? They r also being bullied and sex trafficked. Should they be included in the bullying as well? I get u r scared for both my package and my head; but please show me some respect as a mexican man, and let me make my choices in life.

"Okay, lets analyze this with a summary. at 0:01, we can see 2 women. They both have pageants and it says ""Miss thought she was the one"" and ""Miss also thought she was the one,"" which can have several meanings on what its on. One, their his exes and they thought they were the one for him but they broke up somehow. They also dont seem very happy, and the blonde girl is smoking a cigarette to express emotional distress. Meanwhile, on this scene, 0:09 we can see that they are going to a ball. That could be another reason they thought they ""thought they were the one"" Meaning they didnt get to dance with the person they wanted. at 0:16, we see 2 women, ""Miss freshman year,"" and ""Miss our him in therapy"" Which can clarify these could be his exes. Now, ""Miss focus on my career"" could be the one Olivia is jealous over and and perhaps the somg is about. (A little side note after actually watching the video, 1:16 may actually the girl the song is about and therefore olivia is jealous of, unless its about more of than of them.)",@sturnioloswiftie,2024-04-06T01:40:46Z

She's got a song for almost every situation I swear! I enjoy artists who're able to be diverse and multi-facet when it comes to them being able to express themselves in their art in different ways.,@oceanspotions4401,2024-03-22T17:09:43Z

"A catchy song as always, Queen Olivia! ๐๐",@ivykistler2078,2024-03-22T16:16:15Z
She did it again. Olivia somehow managed to be more generic than Taylor Swift. She carefully handpicked another one of the most generic situations in life and is pretending she wrote and filmed a masterpiece. The delusion is beyond. And the people who likes her music are the most basic I ever witnessed in my lifetime. That's impressive. What a load of shit.,@cedricqw,2024-03-22T15:43:27Z

There's such subtle grunge and Nirvana influence in the chorus and it's amazing. The contrast of the elements of this song are so jarring but work so well it's awesomeee,@FalseBats,2024-03-22T13:59:36Z

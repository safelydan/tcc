"I love Tate, and not trying to diss, Tate is good and all, but I actually have to say Petra markland, September, has her beat, the swedish pop star girl that sings ""cry for you"" Tate is only worth $4 million dollars, Petra markland, September is worth 2.2 billion dollars, And has way better dance moves, sorry Tate I love you honey, Petra markland is way better looking in the face and has a way better slamming body but if I had a vote I would pick Petra marklund better.❤😂",@Marklund-o5w,2025-03-07T23:14:41Z

"What I thought at the time and now reinforced a year later, A one-hit wonder with far too much flash and attitude, lacking the substance to back it up. While the track itself is decent, the video is poorly executed. The lyrics come across as narcissistic and self-indulgent rather than genuinely empowering or celebrating self-love. Instead of inspiring, the “me, me, me” tone feels grating. The dressing and choreography fall flat, and her lack of classical beauty or elegance makes this kind of arrogance even harder to pull off convincingly.",@vamseemk,2025-01-17T01:02:34Z
"I am a fan of Tate, the dancer. Her music does nothing for me. I can barely understand what she says with all the autotune and sounding like she sings from her nasal passages. Pretty little thing but not as amazing as I thought she would be.",@rebekahsalazar3995,2025-01-15T19:18:55Z

"Great example for the young girls there - have plenty of tanned flesh and cleavage on show kids, then you can be like me.

"*You can tell that the guy with the violet fro is a whole ass pro-violence/anti-peace sociopath. Rolls his eyes at people and for what reason? Dramatic purposes. He's not trapped. Nobody's destroying his dignity or violating his rights. He rolls his eyes just to bother. Like, annoying as shit. It's written on his face and mannerisms! Likes heated situations and violence for no reason whatsoever. Animalistic. Not smart. Like, these ain't Gaga's backup dancers. This shit reeks of TRASH gay drama. Now, THIS is the arrogance I speak up about. It's so dumb. And no, I'm not saying that you're not allowed to be unique, I'm telling you to actually be yourself and quit this TRASH drama.*",@earlaweese,2024-05-17T01:48:45Z

"The lyrics, if you listen to them, are a great example of the mental health of our kids.  It ain’t good people.  Lots of people in their teens and early 20s don’t know up from down or how basic human interaction works.   Many don’t understand what it means to work for someone in a defined role.  Look, it’s just a fun song but sure seems representative of the pure confusion that’s out there.",@chupacabra3331,2024-04-08T00:32:17Z

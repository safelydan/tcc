Hmm. Like the song. Video not so much. Like she such a beautiful girl and I feel like this does the opposite. At least in my opinion. It just makes you not look classy at all. I know no one really is anymore but like there was some marilyn vibes in there. Maybe cuz it was black and white and the outfit and the flag thing I unno maybe it’s just me,@rachellesmith1113,2025-01-11T19:18:42Z

"Seeing addison always made me cringe but this song brings a nostalgic feeling not many pop artists give me. Brings me back to my teenage years in the early 2000s. I know ""losing all my innocence in the back seat"" is a different meaning in this song but i did all kinds of crazy things in the back seat of my friends cars losing my innocents in all sorts of different ways. This song has me reminiscing, I'm glad to be where i am now bc of those times and hearing this song today has me feeling some type of way. 🥵",@muckling,2025-01-09T07:20:03Z

"I'm honestly OBSESSED with this tune. And the lyrics...OMG. The only thing I do not appreciate so much is the video. I mean, u can tell she's having lot of fun on the set and also is made to be a bit hilarious, but for that I can't actually feel the sexy vibe that the song itself gives. It's just a personal opinion and a good criticism, maybe a suggestion for future videos (I hope). Apart from that, you literally nailed it, gir l<3",@chiaranunno7383,2024-12-12T00:50:37Z

"Now that I’ve listened to the lyrics more closely, I’m kinda disappointed. Don’t get me wrong, this song, especially the chorus is total war candy, and by itself the chorus could be really good, but the verse’s lyrics just feel kinda meh, shallow, depthless, while the music has this beautiful dreamlike yet suspenseful quality. The music feels sentimental, bit the verses lyrics just don’t hit that… and by itself, the chorus doesn’t get there either.",@Waterwave37,2024-12-08T05:32:04Z

Like jesus crist I came here off a Ludwig video just because I wanted to see how bad it sounded  and holy shit this did not dissapoint with how bad it was . I cant even make out the lyrics. The video is literally just her grinding on a dude trying to drive a car. Every single thing about this is disgusting and unsafe,@Foxexar,2024-10-14T14:54:19Z

Also, she really needs new management.

"Honestly, this one feels a bit overproduced. If there was a studio version with the adlibs from the live concert and a bit less of synth, I have the feeling the song would've been better. The acoustic version alone is magical. A shame it didn't even make it to the standard album either, just like Runaway.",@Th3F4lc0nBl4ckBlu3Xd,2025-02-04T04:01:21Z

I'm hoping he releases a deluxe version of _Hurry Up Tommorow_ like he did w _After Hours_ w this version as well as the accepella and acoustic version on it. I'm really hoping that's the reason this was not on the inital album release.🤞🏼,@NaomiCantora,2025-02-01T01:36:12Z

"Io our dreams (literally) and subconscious, the car represents our body and soul, if we dream about driving a car it means how we are moving in our lives. Infact, in the music video he get into a car accident but we don't  really see any other car. Grabbing our wheel of life and deeply understanding when it's time to stop (""missing the break"") could literally save us. The entire video is a rhetorical representation. Also, there is almost a near to death experience in this video in which he get up after the accident and he starts running towards the light but when the ambulance arrives, he didn't move at all, he is still on the ground.. anyways I love how he transposes his experiences and growth as a man into music and videos + this track is more than amazing. It gives strenghts to always go on in life. Sorry for my english I hope this makes sense :)",@TheGiubani,2024-09-23T19:27:24Z

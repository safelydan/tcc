"Taylor, I know there is probably a 1 and thousand chance of you seeing this comment but I wanted you to know I love you so much the moment I hear one of your songs I start singing the lyrics immediately I have been wanting to go to your concert for 1 year but I can’t and it would mean the world to me if you  respond to this or even just like it I LOVE YOU SO MUCH❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤",@stGradeRockstars-,2025-03-15T18:05:57Z

I Can Do It With A Broken Heart by Taylor Swift highlights Taylor Swift's original vocals and very creative music. The way that the song describes being on the receiving end of  feeling heartbroken in Taylor Swift's I Can Do It With A Broken Heart takes one of life's tragedies of coping with heartbreak with music style/elegance/class.,@stellacarrier8341,2025-01-21T01:02:46Z

"I don't get the attraction.  She overproduces average pop music, her singing sounds coached and contrived, and she can prance well enough.

"I have zero clue how swifties can dance to this song and then shout “more”. This song has broken my heart since the music video came out.  Actually read the lyrics; they arent happy.  If she played this song on piano, it would change everything you think you know about TTPD and probably eras in general.  Like, eras wasnt just a concert.  It was a musical and ballet all in one.  theres so much symbolism in choreo and even the cast of dancers.

The vibe of this song is unmatched.,@BookMusic-r9m,2024-08-23T02:39:03Z
"Some trade secrets should never be unveiled lest the show should lose its special mystique. Taylor's ability to perform even with a broken heart serves as a clear testament of her complete professional dedication to her fans and unparalleled musical career. Ironically, the last thing a true fan would ever want to see is their favorite artist wallowing in deep emotional pain while millions of people sigh at her every move. May she really find a special someone who stays be her side even when the going gets tough. For a unique artist so loved by millions of fans to feel underappreciated by her own lover is a tragedy sincerely worth avoiding, especially if the show must go on. As Freddie Mercury once sang, ""Inside my heart is breaking, my makeup may be flaking, but my smile still stays on.""",@alamartin,2024-08-23T01:10:17Z

Taylors reaction to the massive crowds in and outside stadiums 3. logistics of getting everything to and from cities and all the drama we don't see with that aspect. 4. how she picks the surprise songs 5. all her friends/family coming to the shows and their conversations 6. set list changes and costume changes. 7.

People are just waiting for any action or any mistake she makes so they can judge her and eat her alive. It's tiring. Yeah, she is far from perfect but what y'all want me to do it. Cancel her??

"I knew it! All the easter eggs made me think a video 😅.  Everyone is wanting Rep TV, calm down it will come and this is why she said fans wanting more. I know its hard but let her do her job. Rep TV will come, stop pushing it because it takes a lot for her to rebrand and make new lyrics.",@brittanymason4998,2024-08-21T02:14:23Z

"I can’t stop crying by watching this video and listening to this amazing Taylor’s masterpiece. I’m 17, I’m in japan I’m having so much exams to pursue my future career,at the same time, I was forced to do so under my parent’s huge expectations.  I want to stop this cruel hard life,but I’m not giving up continuing in agony.  BECAUSE I AM SWIFTIE !! She would never give up if she were me.            Thank you for reading my poor English, but my dream as a swiftie is to be able to understand all of lyrics and emphasize her feelings. -from Japan high school swifties",@hanana531,2024-08-21T01:44:30Z

"It's crazy to think that soon The Eras Tour will be lost in the memory. She is the reason i would wake up early. This tour (and Taylor) has saved me but at the same time sent me on an emotional rollercoaster... I go from screaming of excitement, to laughing, to crying and i havent even been. I'll probably never go... but i really dk what im supposed to do when its over. Honestly i think this may be my favorite mv. It just means a lot.",@thatonegirl.13,2024-08-21T00:36:22Z

"Did she direct the video? Cuz I am glad she is taking more control of her visual representation but hear me out, she should have let Joseph Kahn or another more experienced MV director to edit & frame this song. Cuz the mv for Red & New Romantics show scenes from the Speak now & 1989 tour and those music videos are soooo frickin awesome! This song could have been so much more impactful with the crowd shots & maybe even the lyrics on the screen. This feels like a home video. 🤷🏻‍♀️🫣",@aspirin2be,2024-08-20T23:42:53Z

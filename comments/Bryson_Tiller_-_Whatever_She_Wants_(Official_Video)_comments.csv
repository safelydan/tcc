"Love the song but I wish the video could have matched the vibe of it. Like instead of having random fashion nova women twerking in a studio why not put some video vixens in with them driving nice cars, getting their money, shots of them walking in the city, etc like how they did in the early 2000s. Idk I feel like the video had potential and could have had more thought put into it.",@jtwinny4105,2024-03-08T09:08:49Z

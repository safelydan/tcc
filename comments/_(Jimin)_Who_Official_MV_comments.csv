"Adoro la voz de Jimin. Es fascinante, para mi escucharla es como estar en el cielo y que los ángeles te canten al oido. Y aún mejor si la escuchas con auriculares, lo más cerca posible, para apreciar todos sus matices. De su forma de bailar, qué decir, es poesía. Transmite tanto con sus movimientos, se nota su formación de base en danza contemporánea y hace que tenga una sutileza y expresividad con todo su cuerpo envidiable y única. Admiro mucho su tenacidad y deseo de crecer como artista, de explorar en su música, expresar su mensaje, involucrarse en sus proyectos, ya sea componiendo o diseñando coreografías. Y verlo en el escenario es una experiencia única, es su territorio natural. Aún me estremezco cada vez que veo su presentación de Set Me Free Pt 2. Mi sueño sería que algún día hiciera una gira de conciertos porque sé que sería increíble. Jimin, ya sea en el Polo Norte, Groenlandia o en el medio del Pacífico, allí estaría yo para verte, porque eres un artista único e irrepetible, como ningún otro. Te extrañamos, necesitamos tenerte de vuelta. Contando los días para tu regreso.",@pilaraneiros6309,2025-03-09T16:33:12Z

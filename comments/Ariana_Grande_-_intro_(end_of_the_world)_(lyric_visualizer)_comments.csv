"Honestly I hate how good this song is yet they couldn't make it into at least 3 minutes with another verse, chorus and bridge, heck even outro. Like it's so disappointing. Didn't the producers know how golden this melody was and just decide to NOT extend it? Did the writers run out of words?? Ahhh Ariana whyyyy😭😭😭😭",@laura79613,2025-01-27T11:57:25Z

"Looove this song, this whole album is amazing!,  its absolutely delightful  the microseconds of samples, ( like this one, with a microsecond  of Björk's voice) or the interpolations in other tracks or the references to films, theater, pop culture, Madonna, Mc Miller, her fans, herself. This is her first album that make me think of her as a real artist more than a trending pop star. Thanks to everybody involved in this album, producers, art directors, master and mixing engineers, of course Ari, thank you for such a masterpiece!  ps.

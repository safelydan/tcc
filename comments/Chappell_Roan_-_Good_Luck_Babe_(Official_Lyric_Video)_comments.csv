This song is so nostalgic. It takes me back to the time I met my exes' parents for the first time. This song was playing in the car with him and his father. Back when Chappell was rising to fame. Fuck I miss him so much 😕,@Xcyrs,2025-03-15T20:52:53Z
"Music nerd here: they actually slow down a little right after “stop the feeling” in the chorus, and then speed back up. It’s subtle but it’s there. Not talking about the end where it OBVIOUSLY slows.",@mattlawson714,2025-03-15T17:00:52Z

And your voice is so beautiful and endearing :) I saw a cutie wearing some stylish sunglasses who had the softest looking most perfect flawless skin at the beach yesterday on the walking trail who had a resemblance to you, and I wanted to talk to her but I am shy and not an offensive old creep, so I merely smirked and admired her effortless cool while passing. Later saw her again while passing the opposite direction and she had the cutest short short / short skirt combo on :) such a doll :)  anyway, only discovered you recently and I can see what all the fuss is about  :)",@audioeins,2025-03-09T17:26:02Z

As a straight dude who just listened to this for the first time this week. I like the vibe and like the message. I see it and dig it. But I also see that it could be interpreted 2 ways. The way of a girl coming out as a lesbian. And the way of someone regardless of gender or orientation realizing that they love someone after so long and finally admitting it. Either way it’s a very good song.,@jacksonthomas1851,2025-03-02T04:27:02Z

I usually don't care for modern music. I know it sounds pretencious and all that yeah yeah. But I fucking love Chapelle Roan and her music. Girl knows how to sing and the mix of modern musical tropes and the eighties synth vibes to almost all her songs absolutely fucks. Also helps that she is a goddamn gay icon at this point and I hope she continues her rise. Good shit good shit.,@astaroththedaeva9717,2025-02-25T04:48:51Z
"Chappell, I had a beautiful time with your song, 'good luck babe'. As I showered I though: how can anyone leave a woman with just that hit alone and that heartfelt melody of vocals. Than I saw you were gay and I cried with you. Feeling your pain. Although I can't relate to the gay part, it made me think how united we all are and can share your pain. With that song along you've touched so many people. I thank God for your disappointments in all your relationships. Because you've helped others through your experience. I want you to know that my vibes and blessings are being send your way. I send you love and appreciation and we are all one with God! May God bless your way ❤ you are not alone girl!

"This is taking off because it's basically a synthwave song. People of my age and a little older love the beach cuz it literally reminds you of that time and those places I mean it's really good it's a really good song, but that's the big appeal in synthwave has been going hard for a long time now and this is like one of the first mainstream songs that's been pushed into the bigger audience. If you like this check out a band called The Midnight. Like I'm not taking away from this song but their song Los Angeles is much better than this lol.",@InjunJosh,2025-02-12T14:53:14Z

"It's a good song, but looking at the lyrics as a story, it's possible the lover really is a closeted lesbian. But it's more likely that, the character Chappell is portraying is lacking self-awareness. The _contempt_ with which she says 'nothing but a wife' shows how she doesn't respect heterosexual relationships and that they can be loving too. So I think she's using her own lack of understanding/empathy towards straight couples to turn this into an 'us vs them' thing. Maybe her ex left her simply because of Chappell's personality, and she doesn't want to face that. So she blames straightness instead. 'You didn't leave me because I'm shallow; it's because you're in denial.' Seems implausible.",@AlexReynard,2025-02-11T21:38:57Z

But after hearing, ""Good Luck,Babe!"", everything clicked and I knew I was gay. I tried so hard to force myself into this heteronormative lifestyle which just wasn't for me and never will be. I vividly remember picking out a new boy to have a crush on every week just because my friends had boyfriends I though I needed to have one too; Wasn't attracted to them romantically or sexually but I've finally come to the realization that I'm just a woman lover. ""You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling.""~ That line has literally been absorbed into my brain and will never leave, jesus It's so powerful and does something to me EVERY.

I thought the lyrics were incredibly clever, and as a straight guy dealing with the devastating effects of ending a situationship where she couldn't commit, but had strong feelings, this song encapsulates how this girl's life will turn out. She wrote this about her own experiences, but I'm devastated and this song brings such relief.",@michaelmacbeth7171,2024-12-05T07:03:26Z

I'm getting Kate Bush vibes. Huge compliment,@jaycee2687,2024-10-23T13:03:08Z
I first saw Chappell at Coachella. I didn't know what the fuck I was watching and didn't take it seriously but this was her breakout moment. Im crying right now as I'm writing. I vibed a little bit at the show but other than Sabrina Carpenter who was also performing has any other artist touched me so emotionally and made me want  to follow the to hell and back through their expressions of life as they've lived it. its raw and really just a genre of its own. Taylor Swift hit a few of the notes for me but she is just overpopulated ( not hating... I love her) Chappell roan is an elevated version of Taylor with brilliant vocals,@ryankrauss5622,2024-10-22T15:18:37Z

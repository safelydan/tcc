Dude this song mam it talks about a toxic gaslighting relationship but yet something about the beat is so addictive and nostalgic like those 90s and 2000s romance thriller movies,@AssembleRISE,2025-02-02T17:55:51Z

this song makes me nostalgic for some reason haha,@frozenapple9776,2024-11-15T01:53:10Z
"It's a catchy track but the lyrics really bug me - he says ""not tryna to be romantic, I'll hit it from the back just so you don't get attached"", yet he also claims just before that ""I like the way you kiss me, I can tell you miss me""; the two statements are clearly contradictory. He doesn't want for her to get attached, yet he likes that he kisses her in a way which indicates she misses him i.e. actually is attached. The sum effect is to make the song sound insincere and confused.",@PhatInAHat,2024-11-11T17:04:41Z
I hate autoplay for sending me here. There is not a single song that has more infuriating lyrics than this. It makes me want to scratch my eyes out. Doesn’t help that the guy who wrote this is actually a certified asshole,@Fink5,2024-10-31T09:20:31Z

Nice tune and interesting voice modulation from female to male to androgynous. I do kinda wish there was and actual band however... but he is talented.  This sort of reminds me of vintage Fischerspooner or Caribou with a touch of The Weeknd style vocals.,@chrisginsburg6611,2024-07-26T20:19:42Z

"For those who have been in relationships like the one described in the lyrics, they know the range of feelings it evokes, whether it's euphoria, anguish, melancholy, regret, and a series of others. Listening to this song from that perspective adds tremendous depth. It is quite heartless to listen from a first-person point of view, but the one who is in love, even if deluded, leaves a small door of hope for humanity.",@HermanoCavalcante-t7o,2024-06-19T19:42:05Z

"Today it all sounds the same, repetitive not bad, well produced but in the end not very interesting. Often the better songs go back to the past. This one does that all too and yet, it catches attention. The secret? Not a lack of repetitive elements for sure, on the contrary but somehow it sounds like those who make it were inspired, liked this song themselves. It's shorter than usual. I wonder if they had discussions about this. Why??",@jean-pierredevent970,2024-05-05T11:58:36Z

I just found out Artemas is a London based producer that is why this song is absolutely brilliant.  The Brits know how to make super catchy musid.

"I remixed this track with similar perspective adding a burst of creative energy. Fully immersed in the essence of the music, I found myself drawn to the enduring charm of its basic harmonies and the steadfast reliability of its song structure. It's like rediscovering an old favorite with new eyes – there's a sense of familiarity that brings comfort, yet there's also an exciting element of exploration as I delve deeper into its intricacies. With each beat and melody, I'm reminded of the timeless beauty inherent in simplicity, and the profound impact that tried-and-true methods can have on a listener's soul. In a world of constant change and innovation, there's something deeply reassuring about returning to the roots of what makes music truly captivating.",@KODIHARPER,2024-04-05T19:37:01Z
"I’m sorry artemas, first time I heard this song I was like “this is a really good song”, but within 15 mins I’ve overheard this song from all the wanna be “bodybuilders” and the wanna be “influencers” videos using this song. Then I heard the song more and was like “ the beat sounds like mareux - perfect girl” . It’s a good song, but idk if I’ll hear it within the next 5 months",@AndrizzyG69,2024-04-05T18:49:23Z

"Is it a woman singing or auto tune? If it's a woman then ""I'll hit it from the back"" doesn't make a lot of sense, and if it's auto tune Artemas then why did he turn his voice into a woman's voice?

"Dang, the lyrics..It just sounds so sad. I genuinely feel bad for the girl. He doesn't actually love her. Just what she can give to him. I know this is in music all the time, these subjects. But this hit a little hard. It's just so heartless and reflects a lot of emotionally abusive//unavailable relationships of today. Hope others like the girl character (idk if she's real or not) find connections they deserve, who cherish them as much as she cherishes her friends/lovers/partners, whatever it may be. Equally in love and/ or connected.",@aspen5151,2024-04-03T04:07:55Z

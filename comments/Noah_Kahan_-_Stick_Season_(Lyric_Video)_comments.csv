listening on repeat because i love him more then anything in the world and i can’t even explain it but i made a giant rant it my notes about him and im so inlove but i have no chance and im crying over him like i always do and my friends told him everything and he hates me now because he knows i was stalking him a lot and now he stopped texting me and talking to me at all and we used to be so close but it’s all over and he’s moving schools next quarter because he lives far away from the school and like 1 1/2 hours away from me and the thought of him not being in my life just shatters my heart,@ululonokapu,2024-10-20T09:42:18Z

"Heard this accidentally during my nephew's end of school musical today. Heard it before once or twice but never paid much attention to it. Tonight figured to look it up, and armed with just the word ""sticks"" and song, actually found the song (thankfully the title isn't something completely different). It's quite nice the lyrics are shown in the video, and reading along to the song it's a shame I never looked it up before. The lyrics really hit home and is a close second to a song called ""bees"" (the ballroom thieves), which has brilliant lyrics in my opinion. Anyway, thanks for makiing a song that's gonna be on repeat for a while.",@robinvos1703,2024-07-10T23:33:16Z

I’ve learned the hard way, if you’re always looking to the future you never know what you’ve got until it’s gone and you’re chasing something that might not exist, love what you have now, more may come but you always lose it.

This brings me to my dad. Someone I loved, but never knew deeply unfortunately. He never talked to me except for the usual small talk. I was naive back then. I found out the hard truth about him and now that he passed, I wish I could've asked him why.

"it's in sort of a way terrifying how many lyrics I related to. the feeling of loss, inheriting bad parts of my dad and wanting to go back to a time that the one important person in my life was there, but then left as soon as I told her my true feelings for her. I still see her most days, but it isn't the same. She forgot me while I couldn't forget what we had, and now I'm just half a person, acting like im whole. and all too soon, at the age of 15, while many people in these comments are adults. gotta love life",@s_xm1z,2023-12-24T01:36:54Z

"You know, that set of lyrics ""And I’ll dream each night of some version of you that I might not have but I did not lose"" gave me a realization. Even if things went sour, even if things hurt now, you can always run around in your memories and spend time with them back when things were good. Because it was, and that's okay, and though it may have changed, you still experienced it. You still loved one another, in a safe space, and that person is still there! Just in your head. And that's not too bad, really.",@genuinelyjustJD,2023-09-04T07:19:03Z

"This is honestly a perfect song. Even the lyrics that dont apply to me directly induce empathy. ""I'll dream each night of some version of you that I might not have but I did not lose"" hits anyone thats had a past relationship (even if you've moved on and are happy).  ""I am no longer funny because I miss the way you laugh"" is accurate to after a breakup when you find yourself laughing but then get sad bc you think about how that happy moment could have been shared with your ex. The ""darkness inherited from dad"" doesnt apply to me but I've seen it in my friends, SOs, and family members.",@aydinsha,2023-05-31T04:15:10Z

I had never felt so impacted and encompassed by current music until DC, and the connection that Chris had/has with his fans, both individually and as a crowd, was so powerful.

Could i have a random wild goat dropping them on my walk? Idk. But im still gonna burn em. As for lyrics seems kinda jumping all over the place. Having demonic friends in high places can definatly help overlook any raw talent one might have. Weather or not there's a longjivity to this psyops will only be told in time.

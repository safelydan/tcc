This video gives me ‘Death becomes her’ and ‘War of the Roses’ vibes and I am soo here for it. Love this video just as much as the song!,@alanaisaiah3693,2025-03-10T10:37:17Z
"Mmmm...the song explores the theme of jealousy and the lingering bond between ex-lovers... Sabrina is really addressing someone who has gotten back together with his ex, insinuating that, despite the new relationship, the author’s presence is still palpable. The line “You’ll just have to taste me when he’s kissin’ you” expresses the idea that, even though the relationship is over, the author is still a part of his ex’s life... so much so that the new partner cannot help but feel his presence! It is also very strong the way Sabrina emphasizes how some of his ex’s habits and behaviors, such as jokes or affectionate gestures, were learned from him (I am referring to “He’s funny, now all his jokes hit different / Guess who he learned that from?”). This lyric maybe could seem ""trivial"", but... it is very deep indeed 😊😊",@aliceaccorsi2782,2025-03-08T20:06:44Z

I would not like to take part in that. I honestly do not like the thought of living in a sick disgusting world or in a world where I think people are sick and disgusting, but for some reason have some thoughts I can’t actually die, like physically maybe I can, but then some healing shocking mind erasing, technology and, or magic or whatever happens you know regrowth back to a baby change look genes nutrition whatever or just keep farming me, so they can nonce off and torture people and try to send us to hell.",@Leestevensmusic,2025-02-09T19:06:57Z

Sure, the excuse will be that it’s done for laughs and is too comical to be taken seriously and no, it’s not serious, nor should it be taken that way, but if this is what constitutes lighthearted today.

"This video was inspired by and pays homage to the movie ""Death Becomes Her"" a fun 80's classic you'll love which stars Goldie Hawn, Meryl Streep, & Bruce Willis. This video is basically a short version remake of the film that uses all the same gags, storyline, setups/pay offs, and digital effects. ""Death Becomes Her"" is one of my absolute favorite movies from the 80's which I've seen hundreds of times thru years, and Sabrina did such an amazing job recreating it here in this masterpiece! The only difference between the two is Goldie and Meryl don't have a kissing scene.  You guys have to now see ""Death Becomes Her."" Trust me, you'll love it and you'll thank Sabrina Carpenter for showing it some love, because it's such an underrated romance horror classic.",@QuincyDisneyVegan,2025-01-05T12:42:35Z

I know it's music but if you reverse these types of lyric's and the dude was telling another dude that he's tasting him through his ex girl, you get my point.  If your relationship doesn't work out, please move forward.  The fact that you have to write a song about him and even sing about it shows that your still living in the past.  In all theses type of song, he has moved on.  But we know it's all about misleading these young women (buyers) to make that money.",@firstapplesauce8731,2024-11-25T15:37:19Z

That tombstone shot spoke to me in a way. Figuratively speaking. Hypothetically? Perhaps that too. 🤷🏻 What are you doing right now right now? Other than four productions this 2024 final months of the year? 👀 what are you wearing? “Team” something shirt? You woman you. I’m totally not watching reruns of YOu nor am I going to rewatch Studio 666👀 I could keep on going but maybe I will watch compared to these delays of productions. Anyway…cheers.

It's like a smoky jazz club 🎷 in the dead of night 🌃, with flickering candlelight 🕯️ casting long, dancing shadows 💃 on the walls. The music is a seductive whisper 🤫, a siren song 🧜‍♀️ that promises both ecstasy and danger 😈. You can almost smell the heady perfume 👃 of the women in their shimmering gowns ✨, the scent of desperation and desire 💔 mingling with the aroma of spilled champagne 🍾. The melody is a haunting waltz 💃, a slow, seductive sway 💃 that draws you in, then pulls you back out, leaving you breathless and wanting more 😮. It's a song that reminds you that beauty can be a mask 🎭, a fleeting illusion 💫, and that beneath the surface, there's a darkness 🌑 that lurks, waiting to be unleashed 😈.",@thecurioustryoone466,2024-10-14T07:50:50Z

Only now seeing this and love the Death Becomes Her vibes!,@Wolfhailstorm,2024-10-08T20:32:19Z
"What a crazy video with sex,violence,comedy and horror. Song is cute. We have a Sabrina Carpenter frenzy right now.  With about 10 of her songs in the Hot 100. And 3 out of 5 were recently holding down the top 5 songs in America with 'Taste' , 'Please Please Please' and  her first and biggest hit 'Espresso'.  Ironically the Beatles when they controlled the top 5 slots simultaneously in April 1964 they also had a song with the word Please in it. ' Please Please Me'",@ArtieSoden,2024-10-08T15:45:23Z

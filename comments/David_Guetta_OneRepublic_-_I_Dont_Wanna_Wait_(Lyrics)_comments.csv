"Can you guys mention similar songs, really love the vibe",@Masukkannama01,2025-01-05T12:17:32Z
I love this song! It reminds me of another one that is this same one but with different lyrics!,@GirlThat_MakesMusic,2024-12-26T15:07:17Z
Is it that difficult to come up with an original melody for your chorus? Does everything have to be a cheap copy of better songs from the past?,@untitled568,2024-12-19T21:26:07Z
"Zero originality, but I love this OG beat ❤",@Rittendaux,2024-12-02T13:00:13Z
I realized this has the same melody of Dragostea Din Tei.,@juliirubyx,2024-11-21T15:43:11Z

People really need to start making their own stuff. like really this is crap. They took the melody and beat from a song that was from the dawn of YouTube and they are trying to pass it off as their own sad and pathetic.,@codybooth520,2024-06-08T18:08:16Z

"🎵 Absolutely love 'I Don't Wanna Wait' by OneRepublic and David Guetta, it's such a vibe! 🔥 But hey, have you checked out my remix of this banger? 🚀 I've put my own spin on it, injecting those festival feels and fresh beats that'll keep you grooving all day long! Don't miss out - head over to my profile and give it a listen! Let's keep the music alive! 🎶",@martinmillerofficial,2024-04-21T18:50:15Z

Nice way to bring back a classic :) I also ended up remixing David's version giving it a Hardstyle twist. Hope y'all like it.,@thehardforce4974,2024-04-12T19:55:22Z

The first song that came to my mind was “ItaloBrothers - My life is a party” with their chorus,@mathiasmikkelsen6062,2024-04-05T23:21:25Z
Dragostea Din Tei Vibes,@todorbodurov6793,2024-04-05T19:54:13Z
"Catchy song, weak drop… @ David Guetta",@Jonah_hepas,2024-04-05T17:23:46Z
Haha 😂 it's Dragoatea din tei !  😅😅 Wtf !? You think if you change the lyrics that by the way are basic people don't realise it's a rip off?,@vornik24,2024-04-05T13:40:27Z
I’m assuming they got permission from O-Zone to steal the chorus?,@Simply_GenX,2024-04-05T01:53:05Z

"I was at the supermarket with my little one when a song started playing on the radio. Without missing a beat, my 4-year-old son instantly said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Jungkook, Mommy!‚Äù‚Äîand even started humming along! His popularity truly knows no bounds! We love you, JK!",@itsmeeekateyyy,2025-03-21T08:04:18Z

"Amy Lee, of the rock band Evanescence, gave an interview last year that stuck with me, and I want to talk about it now, since people are getting both brave and showing a decided lack of comprehension. Amy spoke of being small, female, and young in rock music when Evanescence began, and that was why she was so determined to do EVERYTHING herself. It was a way to protect herself, as well as a way to control the musical output. Now, over TWO DECADES LATER, she says she doesn't have that need to ""prove herself"" anymore and works with many others on her music. Let's put this in terms of Jungkook. He recorded Golden for one reason, according to him: to show his voice/talents on different genres. He was ALREADY confident enough in his skills as a vocalist that he had producers and writers giving him songs to make the perfect album. Jungkook debuted with Golden BECAUSE he had nothing to prove EXCEPT his voice. He wanted ‚Äî he CHOSE ‚Äî to prove he was a singer and a performer. He already proved he was a writer, producer, mixer, vocal coach, vocal arranger, composer and even studio/session singer. He is already a full KOMCA member because songs he wrote are THAT successful and impactful. He proved what he could do behind the scenes. He wanted to NOW prove what a true singer he was. And that is so admirable, and so impressive, that upon his DEBUT album, he was so confident in himself that he chose songs like Standing Next to You and Somebody. That he wanted to show the world that Jeon Jung Kook is a SINGER first and foremost. So grateful to stan someone with such depth and breadth of talent, as well as such confidence.",@JeonJk-u6p,2025-02-08T19:21:34Z

"Looking at JK is pure joy, the music video is also great. But recently I was listening to SNTY on headphones, lying on a hammock in the garden. An unforgettable experience.

"I find his vocal stability exceptionally impressive, especially given the challenging dance jumps and extreme cardio moves he performs with such smoothness. While these elements would be daunting for many, he executes them effortlessly. His talent deserves much more recognition. I deeply admire and respect him for his dedication and willingness to push boundaries, even when it makes him appear controversial. However, this controversy should be viewed positively. It‚Äôs not just his extraordinary beauty that highlights his ethereal qualities, but also his humility. Sometimes, it feels like he‚Äôs a once-in-a-lifetime talent‚Äîone who is unparalleled and incomparable. Not just the Golden Maknae, but a vocalist who shines even brighter than gold.",@btsaresevenpreciousgemsinm1884,2024-08-06T23:34:44Z

"Hey guys, please read, I'm going to talk about my personal problems. Everything is getting worse and worse, my parents' fights are getting more and more frequent and worse, I'm not even impressed anymore, since I've witnessed these fights since I was little, and my psychology is almost finished, I just don't know what to do anymore, everything I do people look at me in a bad way, and I really hope that my new school helps me a little to have a minimum of happiness that I no longer have, I just want it all to end once and for all, I just want to cry but I can't, I want to smile but I can't, I don't feel any kind of emotion anymore, ""hey but I saw you so happy, you talk to everyone normally."" I just ""try"" to make people believe that I'm fine, but I'm not, it's just a mask hiding everything I'm feeling, I'm just standing, but I believe it will get better, if not I would have already ""ended it all"" if you know what I mean, but anyway, I just hope everything gets better, I still have a little hope that it will happen, thank you very much if you've read this far, it's just a personal rant. Thank you and good night.",@DarkdeDark,2025-03-16T23:23:29Z

I'm a 24 yo dude. I've heard this chorus alot in videos. I've hesitated to look the full song up until now because I knew it'd make me cry. Sure enough. But it's odd my tears fall out at small things like this but in real time it's like i freel like it takes longer for your emotions to register.  I've found love alot in my young life but I always took it for granted up until recent years where i have had no one. We shouldn't be okay with breaking people's hearts just because we felt that way once upon a time too. We need to be out here being heroes giving & expecting nothing in return,@zacharycatastrophee1859,2025-02-21T11:20:50Z

"A um mês e pouco terminei meu relacionamento, ela era tudo para mim, a mulher que eu mais amava na vida, porém nosso relacionamento nunca foi aceito, por que somos duas garotas, meu pais pararam de falar comigo, falaram muitas coisas que me deixou triste, mas eu tinha lutado tanto pelo nosso relacionamento, pra dá tudo certo, eu fazia de tudo pra ver ela, pra poder passar só um minuto com ela, mas infelizmente eu não posso mais, eu tinha que escolher entre ela ou minha família, por muito tempo escolhi ela, escolhi ser feliz com ela, mas ouvir aquelas coisas me deixou muito triste, por que a única coisa que eu queria era ser feliz com ela, e eu nunca poderei. Então eu decidi terminar, mas eu não queria, eu a amava e a amo, e toda vez que eu escuto essa música eu me lembro de todos os nossos momentos que estávamos felizes, eu te amo Anna Clara, e sempre vou te amar.",@novajerusalemvidros1811,2025-02-07T22:05:55Z

"Just a side opinion...speed your song up to 1.15 and listen. Way more energy but keeps the same feel. Has more of a come with me tone, than a follow me if you want to. Again, just me...but I see more images that tells the story of the song when sped up. Even your vocals feel like they are more in the pocket with a cent lead, instead of draggin 3 cents behind. I'll listen and have listened a few times at 1.15, I would and will not at normal. Crazy...Keep rockin though and doing your thang...",@iansmith3261,2025-01-17T00:52:20Z

I think about it all day long, I can't get enough of it. I developped extremely deep anxiety and could no longer be friends with her. She misses me but doesn't want to love me the way I love her.

"When I first heard this song, I just fell in love with it and It automatically made me remember of my special person, but everything just changed between us now.. it made me miss our little late night talks, when I used to stay up late to wait for their texts, our sweet conversations, when I used to stay up to wait for their texts, their company, all the moments when we used to laughed sm together.. the smiles I get just from one text from them, and the way they made you feel loved.. it feels like a bittersweet ending in a story when you both didn’t end up happily yet even in both of your separate ways.. there’s beautiful memories in those days you both had together,  despite the fights, misunderstandings, chaos that happened and you’d wish you can bring back those days back when everything was okay between you two, but you’re starting to slowly accept it now that it has to happen.. cause if it’s meant to be, then it will be, but you’re finally letting go and closing that chapter after holding on it for so long cause you can’t accept it still.. and it’s something that made you stronger and better person from those experiences. I just wanna write how this song makes me feel cause it’s more than just a feeling that I can’t describe, it feels so much to what I’m experiencing rn like memories flooding in remembering those happy moments you had with someone and even though you’re finally accepting the way things turned out, they will forever be special to you and you will forever treasure those moments and somewhere deep in your heart and glimpse of hope that maybe.. maybe one day.. ya’ll will meet one more time and you will be happy together again..",@euphxrz,2024-12-03T03:29:14Z

"You know when people say that certain songs or artists are therapeutic, this song makes me feel every emotion that is possible and I love it it, it brings you up down and back up it has a great story amazing lyrics and it actually makes you feel something like music should, this song saved my life i know it's just a song but it helps express myself and it's just so good all I can do is listen and feel and I just let go thank you",@trayky3172,2024-10-22T23:48:26Z
This song makes me feel like I wanna scream silently on top of my lungs. Full of emotions but can't describe what I'm feeling.,@jancedrickinstrella6176,2024-10-21T03:56:29Z
this gives some serious summer 2019 vibes,@xpqxanova,2024-10-21T00:06:32Z
"I liked this girl since the day she transferred to my school,her laugh,her voice,her smile...everything about her is just so perfect.I always stare at her all the time she's just so gorgeous I can't help it,i wish i could tell her my feelings but we have never talked before and i know she likes boys.And it feels so right yet so wrong because my family is Muslim,I'm an atheist and I don't think they would ever accept me,even though I don't believe in god I'm still scared because it's a sin and it also makes me feel bad to like girls as a girl.I tried really hard to like boys but she's just so kind and perfect,this song reminds me of her.I already know we will never be together and she won't ever like me back but I'll still love her.Maybe we could've been in another universe,but why not in this one?",@cagla3067,2024-10-19T22:03:48Z
"I am 62, gay and male. I first heard this on some Tik Tok videos so I had to look it up (that line ""I don't believe in God but I believe that your my savior"" really stuck in my brain!) I know tons of people have heard this and thought it was a guy singing it! (Got to admit so did I!). Then when I finally heard the WHOLE SONG I was blown away! WOW! And that is was by a woman? MORE WOW!! The manufactured music of today is nothing I can really enjoy (for me, give me 60s-90s music and some post 2000 stuff, but that techno-synth-rap crap that it mostly out now is all the same) so when I hear what I consider a ""clean"" sound like this one, I can really enjoy it. And these are some of the BEST lyrics I have heard in a while! (like ""We can run away to the walls inside your house"" is very slick as well as ""When you get a taste can you tell me what's my flavor? VERY SLICK!!) She talks about sex without hitting you over the head with it! I love that! And I love that it is woman-woman song!! Go GIGI!!",@johngreener9784,2024-10-19T19:37:01Z
This song is so deep. Its love and everything everyone wants. Its so amazing bro i have loved this song forever (nit really) when u hear this song i get fireworks!! So prefect❤,@Ick_Cringe,2024-10-18T23:08:38Z
"It hits like pasilyo the first time I heard it… my god, it’s so beautifully done, it’s honestly so much to take from one song. I feel such a soft yet strong sense from the plead at the beginning, exactly how I wish someone would talk to me like in that tone, soft, gentle and genuinely caring, wholeheartedly. The fact that my parents are homophobic and would probably find me disgusting if I ever told them that I compassionately loved a girl makes this song even more special.",@Idk-xm6kk,2024-10-17T23:15:42Z

I found this song from yt shorts ( ofc. 😩) but when I looked this song up at first I was hesitant but now it’s my favorite song it gives me a mixed emotion of sadness and joy it makes me think of my bf but then also happiness and freedom while also realizing I can’t truly be free and have privacy due to my strict parents and then it gives me like- anixety of never having freedom? But then also when I’m an adult I will have to pay bills and be alone idk it’s just an amazing song,@Wcue_edits_,2024-10-15T04:36:52Z

"“Sailor Song"" has a special meaning in my life. It's not just a song, but a soundtrack that accompanies me in important moments, bringing a unique feeling of connection and reflection. Every time I hear it, I am led to revisit memories and feelings that help me better understand who I am and how I see the world. It's like an emotional anchor point, something that always makes me feel at home, regardless of who I am.",@Peuzzx7,2024-10-05T18:14:58Z

"Istg, this song wrecks me in the worst and best possible ways at the same time. I'm so in love with this guy that it hurts physically, and to know i will never, never be with him is basically slaughter on my last two finctioning braincells. I just want to be lovable, and the more time passes the more i see that i might never be lovable. I just wanted to be able to love someone freely, i want to be able to tell him i love him 50 times a day, and hug him, and comfort him and tell him that he's not stupid, or short, or ugly, he lools like an angel in my eyes. It hurts that i cannot show him this love. And it hurts that i will never be loved that way i love others!!",@mihaelaandries3451,2024-09-13T13:24:03Z

If only half the lyrics were actually written by them. Good thing the real writer actually likes there music. too bad he closed his public social media accounts. But I'm sure they could find a way to future collaborate. Same goes for several other newer artist not being mentioned in the here or the now. I'm sure they know a round about way to use mutual contacts to reach the person.,@JaycsBetterwood,2025-02-02T03:04:51Z

"Red lights in Blurryface represent the bishops, but the red lights are during the song bandito. Tyler just came back from Dema, and is recovering from being brainwashed, but has been harolded a hero, and called Clancy. The brainwashing the bishops did is being taught subtly to the banditos. Far fetched theory I know. Tell me what you think. Also, he opens a door 1:34 .

"The Radiohead piano intro, into a EDM style secondary intro, into a hip-hop Latin groove inspired verse, into an alt. rock style chorus‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all very jarring, but somehow it works.

"‚ÄúIlluminati Hand Symbol‚Äù? No.. not originally at least. that‚Äôs part of the point of the story of Trench. Remember the song ‚ÄúLevitate‚Äù? Tyler did his history! He was referring to the Knights Templar, formerly known as ‚ÄòBrothers of/from the East‚Äô.. ‚ÄúEast is Up!‚Äù remember ‚ÄúNico & The Niner‚Äôs? Anyway, the Brothers of the East could levitate.. they had many spiritual gifts that weren‚Äôt so common (not ‚ÄòMagic‚Äô in the sense that they refer to today) no.. sorta like Jesus Christ. They in fact admired Jesus Christ.. they were acquainted perhaps. However, they had a great respect for John the Baptist because he is said to have been the one who helped & assisted Jesus Christ with understanding and further developing his spiritual gifts. Here with Twenty One Pilots, Tyler is going pretty deep! & yes it does insight a certain ‚Äúelite‚Äù group of ppl as the said ‚Äúilluminati‚Äù.. but not because they‚Äôre apart of it! No.. It‚Äôs because he over-stands how it all came to be about. Through some sort of ‚Äòinfiltration‚Äô. Didn‚Äôt mean to write a story here. But I‚Äôve been piecing this all together myself. And if you listen to the music closely, Tyler has BEEN revealing the truth.. very thoroughly might I add. Take care!",@wild-heartz-xoxo,2024-03-06T04:06:47Z

Because I know now we're saying they're the same person, but something just doesn't click. Plus, well maybe i'm reading into it, but it's weird how there's tyler with the mask on and tyler without, like they're separate.

"Apple music lyrics say ""CAN fall asleep twice"" and Youtube lyrics ""CAN'T fall asleep twice."" That seems like a VERY big difference.",@AndrewRunnels-h2h,2024-03-01T17:17:01Z
"Literally can‚Äôt stop listening to this. The intro is like being in a movie, the call back to previous albums with the Bandito lyrics and ‚Äúwelcome back to trench‚Äù is a reference to the last 15 seconds of Levitate. Then the switch on tempo is so badass. I‚Äôm INVESTED in this album.",@cjhummer,2024-03-01T17:06:58Z

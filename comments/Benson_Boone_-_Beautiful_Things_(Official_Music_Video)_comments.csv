"You are insane, my friend. You have so much emotion to give to this world. To me, it's like comparing you to the greatest musical geniuses of all time. The power of your music is awesome. In an era where reggaeton and EDM are breaking records, your music stands far apart in terms of message, energy, and creativity. It strongly reminds me of grunge music in the '90s—a glorious decade that we now recognize as one of the greatest moments in music history.",@MarcelTomasnovellas,2025-03-11T10:48:42Z

"This brings back memories of my early 20s when I was with my true love. Now, decades later, as an old and a bit wiser man, I regret letting her go. She was perfect, closest to a soul mate if there ever was one. I was foolish and arrogant as a young man. We both went overseas to different countries to chase our careers and back then  I thought a long distance relationship wouldnt work. I should have been more supportive and understanding.

Then one day, I was listening to an album and guess what this song came up! It was even better! I haven't stopped playing it since. The lyrics do something to my spirit! I resonate with the words; it's a hidden gem, a Godly tune for me! Brilliant! I play this song every day and guess what again, I never heard of Benson Boone!

"As someone with cptsd, who’s struggled so much with resisting all the beautiful things that have come into my life — my amazing partner, our home, living in the mountains, having a farm, having my own business — this song has and still does resonate deeply especially “if everything’s good and it’s great then why do I sit and wait til it’s gone” there’s so much to learn from that, because we may resist, push away or isolate ourselves from what we want most because we don’t feel deserving and then if we’re successful in self sabotage we can cause our very own worst fears to come true, by design of our own making. Which is why it’s so important to heal any unworthiness wounds we may have that hinder our ability to accept, embrace and cherish that which we have and love so much",@Tallulahswonderland,2025-02-28T15:07:04Z

"Been hearing a lot of people say ""this is cringe"", ""this is just screaming"", ""oh my god he can't even sing"", ""my neighbour's baby can scream better than he does"" but I clicked on this with no preconceived notions. And I was so impressed. This song is brilliant and it perfectly captures the emotions I am currently going through. The high notes are so impactful and empowering and nowhere close to being ""cringe"" or plain screaming. I thoroughly enjoyed this but I respect the opinions of everyone who thinks otherwise. Even if you do hate the song, please don't say that it was easy to make. Hitting those notes would take a lot of skill.",@anonymos226,2025-02-14T06:51:56Z

"I am not sure if I am alright, really my emotions are all over the place one moment I am up the next i am down , sometimes i feel so empty as though there is a hole where my heart should be , just an emptiness inside me, but I tend to just say I am okay it is simpler that way nobody ever asks you to elaborate on being okay there are moments when everything feels confusing, days blend together and overthinking kills every happy moment. My mind races on to replay every moment every regret. I question whether it is all going to make sense someday if the ache will ease, right now it feels like i am lost, I look at the mirror and all I see is a stranger.",@edmondilbawi,2025-01-27T20:09:47Z

"My sweet baby girl, #forever17 since December 2021. I sing this for her and for the beautiful things that remain after her passing. Knowing there’s always more the universe can take. You just have to be present in every moment with the people you love without fear.",@Oysterwang,2025-01-27T07:04:18Z

"❤❤❤ I will never get tired of this song!!! I come from the era where power ballads were what made hard rock bands famous! I still love all of those bands from the late 80s through the 90s! Their songs have for the most part stood the test of time.. This and many more of your songs will too!!! The reason? Its everything.. for me its the lyrics and the guitar rips! The way the drummer understands his own place in the build ups and I'd swear y'all have been playing together for at least 10-15 years! The power behind the music tells you its just gonna become something amazing! The build ups within the song itself tells you there is so much more and you don't let us down! God has truly blessed you with these amazing musicians in your band and the gifts you have of writing all of the songs I have heard... God doesn't do that unless He wants you to make your own beautiful mark on this world.  He wants us to enjoy life, to have JOY in our lives, bc that is a part of Him too!",@loriskiba3921,2025-01-25T21:35:50Z
Mannnnnn what’s this song. Litres of tears from my eyes now. You are completely responsible for this stunning voice and how you gave the emotional energy out loud. This song is the best ever lifelong love of my life till I get old & die ♥ I’ll pass it on to my generation too. Abundant love to you ♥,@GirlBehindTheCode,2025-01-25T07:25:56Z

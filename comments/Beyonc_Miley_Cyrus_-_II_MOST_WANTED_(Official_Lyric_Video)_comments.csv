"Most of the complaints are just coming here from the Grammy win and people that are the loudest don't really have an ear for actual music because of their own noise. Both Beyonce and Miley compliment each other on this song, the fact that they are singing within the same octave with each bringing their uniqueness in each of their voices. Making it a true duet with each singer taking a line and then joining together for the chorus and adlibs is just musical science.",@WadeM-fp2ii,2025-02-06T00:10:58Z

"I have to admit that I skipped over this song often, my aunt who was my partner in crime passed away back in January after a long fight with some health issues. She came to me in a dream and this song was playing low in the dream while she was sitting there. I woke up to see if maybe I had left the tv on or if my phone was playing music but the lyrics were haunting me and I’m like this sounds familiar, when I realized what song it was it was this one. It now has a whole different meaning to me and it makes me so emotional when I hear it.",@ChristianElijah-d7d,2024-09-05T03:08:02Z

Both artists are too big to do a duet. Both singing over one another. That's not harmony. That's ego. Country Music is not for Beyonce; she does not have the vocal commands needed to do country music fans proud. It's like asking Mariah Carey to do Country Music. Both artists were coached for any genre except country. Beyonce is SO talented... immensely talented. Leave country music to the hicks and twangers.,@barbarakosloski9260,2024-04-03T17:15:52Z

"This song is sublime and an instant classic.  I have always thought their voices are absolutely beautiful, and hearing them in a duet is what I needed today.  For some reason, I got emotional when I heard the lines: ""Know we're jumping the gun, but we're both still young. One day we won't be.""  Beyonce and Miley have the extraordinary ability to make you feel like they're telling your story. Kudos to both for a job well done.",@Mimi-zk9ks,2024-04-03T14:47:15Z

Beyonce is sing way too hard too early in the song. The build-up would work with the amount of power/growling she's using. Miley is using a more neutral/mellow tone and using more power vocals towards the end. I could barely hear Miley essentially during the duet.  It's not a bad song. I just wished it was arranged a bit better.,@DorothyZbornak4,2024-03-31T19:34:51Z

Is it just me or is it most difficult to figure which song is the best in this beautiful compilation of music. And no I'm a fan of no one but I do appreciate musicality and lyrical arrangement in Sonic awesomeness is just so beautiful to hear every single track in this compilation of the second act. Not certain but this song is melodically divine and the collab is on fire but what really makes every single track is that it is so well thought out and I'm not certain if younger generations who don't know history of certain musics see the mini correlations that she has done with each and every track and how it's building upon not just our history throughout music and country music in specific but she collapsed and connects the dots with other beautiful forms of folk music the lyrical content the melody content the arrangement content is just top tier and so well thought out given a history lesson along with being so currently and socially that it may miss a lot of individuals listening young or old and so kudos every time I hear a track I'm just overwhelmed with joy that I started to cry and it is so beautifulto see such spiritually mentally emotionally thought out music,@lemuelmalik8347,2024-03-31T06:09:08Z
First of all this collab is classically iconic on top of that they giving us Stevie nicks vibes in this song and the lyrics are so beautiful have me crying and joy of the elements that are throughout this song and throughout this whole album EP whatever it's called nowadays LOL such beautiful eclectic work building upon the histories of just humanity in music and we have to recognize the collective efforts that the genius and all that she worked with put into this work. Have you noticed what she did with Jolene my goodness is it an inspiration not only does she give honor to Dolly Parton but she has her own generational spin lyrically and situationally in the song and it is awesomely done with the nuances of changing you know the vibe she's the epitome of that sort of like a song just switching up tone and Melody and feeling but then going back we have to recognize this greatness,@lemuelmalik8347,2024-03-31T06:02:26Z

This is definitely their BEST pop / country song they have ever done together. I feel like they should do more country music together in the future. Beyoncé extremely understood the assignment when she put Miley to collaborated with her to this song. I’m so very proud of Miley because she really deserves everything & more.

Vocals on point,@marksuipreyes4570,2024-03-30T15:12:04Z
Sounds nothing like country. With some janky lyrics. Nothing memorable here. Just another bland Beyoncé song.,@PretoChulo,2024-03-30T14:16:47Z
Together their vocals are even more amazing than they are separate. Great song,@rere6275,2024-03-30T13:51:53Z
I'm not a fan of either of these women BUT i must admit they make a nice harmony,@falliblewonder,2024-03-30T13:49:24Z
That And I 😍 vocal duet together had me in a chokehold!,@HaahmayanShaalManasseh,2024-03-30T13:35:27Z
This is genius. Even down to Miley’s lyrics being white and Beyoncé’s being yellow 😩,@BreStylezzz,2024-03-30T13:22:52Z
beyoncé is one of the best vocalist there is!!! i’ll ride for beyonce until the day i die 😂🐝🐝🐝🐝,@BritBrat444,2024-03-30T13:11:57Z
Love the music sound... The lyrics. Trash,@LadyG0029,2024-03-30T13:03:20Z
I like the lyrics 😊,@EmmyRodriguez,2024-03-30T11:38:44Z
They sound amazing together. Beyoncé is belting out that chorus.,@kiandrastewart2329,2024-03-30T11:22:05Z
It's a great song but I couldn't help but feeling like Miley was really holding back her voice to not overshadow Beyonce. Both have incredibly strong vocals but Miley didn't let that show even for a moment in here 😅,@patrycjaleskiewicz1325,2024-03-30T11:14:45Z
Very powerful song from 2 beautiful Queens I'm loving this ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤,@queennancy6820,2024-03-30T10:13:12Z

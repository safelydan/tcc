First time hearing this song I spent about 7 hours listening to this on replay. The beat is so sick. I laid in bed studying this song. Not to sing it back but just listening. I spend more time listening than talking believe it or not. If I do talk it’s something important being said. For me to even comment on something it must be something of importance.  Something good that I see about it or something. Best wishes for you Tyla.,@godsorganiclove,2024-05-02T23:12:34Z

This has elements of Afro beat the south afrikans will obviously deny,@zimtswa149,2023-09-23T23:37:14Z
Who is the choir singing the chorus?,@cartiebenjii26,2023-09-23T21:34:15Z
"Love this. Just sounds a lil off when the hooks drop after the verses. It seems like the verses and chorus were created at different times 🤷🏽‍♂️ like, sonically it all sounds amazing obviously. ALL the vocals. It’s just when the hook drops it come in a bar after when it would traditionally drop. If the producers meant to do that then that’s an artistic choice and das cool but if the mixing engineer didn’t align everything properly idk 🤷🏽‍♂️ - this is just me being a engineer 👨🏾‍💻 don’t mind - an amazing song either way",@MichaelRafael,2023-09-23T14:11:45Z
I think there needs to be a remix with Chris Brown on it. I can just hear his vocals coming thru on this joint… ❤,@jheelle5403,2023-09-23T13:24:15Z
The melody is out of this world,@shanethecoolestshortfilms,2023-09-23T10:18:57Z
It's the VOCAL for me thinking of putting it on a Amapiano Beat,@kyleXfortuin,2023-09-23T03:11:15Z
"The lyrics ""Can you snatch my soul from me"" doesn't sit well for me. I'm all for supporting south African artists growing but we must not be blinded by the hidden msgs in songs, that's why these songs go viral. There's always a meaning behind everything. Jesus is Lord, let's not be brain washed by things of the world.",@sashlee2446,2023-09-22T20:24:43Z

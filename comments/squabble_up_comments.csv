Do you know how stupid this glazing is with Kendrick Lamar. He won 5 Grammys off a diss track. Backwards as f***. Nothing influential about a diss track. I can name a lot of records that should have got those awards. Only reason this happened was to try to make Drake obsolete. Keep trying. You can only beat Drake with Drake. Canadian r&b rapper has got the industry on lock and everyone is mad because they can’t beat him. Bunch of crybabies if you ask me. What happened to competition.

"The origin of Castle Grayskull was related in the read-along book ""Castle Grayskull""[12] as once being the beautiful ""Hall of Wisdom,"" the ""center of Eternian culture and a storehouse of all knowledge of the universe."" The Hall was the meeting place of the Council of Elders. One day, the elders saw a vision of a beautiful woman dressed in snake armor who warned of future danger and also the coming of He-Man. The Elders concentrated all of their power into a magical orb. The Elders then magically transformed the Hall of Wisdom into Castle Grayskull in order to frighten away intruders and protect the orb. This was to have all taken place several centuries before the coming of He-Man. The Castle was then largely forgotten until Man-At-Arms eventually led Prince Adam to Castle Grayskull, where Prince Adam became He-Man using the Sword of Power.",@BeauWolfe-e9n,2025-01-22T01:09:43Z

"The beat to this song is so good amazing production, melody, vocal flow. But I also want to remind artists that Jesus Christ is the way the truth and the life. True wealth, true love, true fulfillment comes in accepting Jesus. People can be earthly wealthy and not truly wealthy. So don’t miss out on Jesus. Everything is spiritual really. We wrestle not against people. The enemy truly has nothing to offer but to steal, use people, and then toss them away when he’s done. Accept Jesus, Romans 10:9-10, and then all of the good things will be an added bonus from a place of already being secure and whole in Christ. Sending love and hope you will truly open your heart to this message.",@LivebyFaith-q2p,2025-01-30T18:12:35Z

"Absolutely obsessed with Playboi Carti’s ""Weekend""! This song is a straight-up vibe from start to finish. The production is next level, with those hauntingly melodic synths and Carti’s signature ad-libs that just hit right. It's the perfect balance of chill but hype, and it captures that carefree, weekend energy perfectly. You can’t help but get lost in the flow of it, whether you're cruising through the city or just vibing at home. Carti never disappoints, and this track is one of his most timeless yet. Total earworm – can’t stop hitting repeat! Highly recommend!",@prasadshinde06,2025-01-27T09:01:36Z

The lyrics between all the songs from this rap beef should be closely examined and be used as evidence. We cannot allow the system to rig and completely scam and rip off its citizens. I demand justice . I demand answers for a contract that I never signed. This just proves the CIA is involved. I will not rest until I have justice . I will never stop speaking out against the corrupt system and the CiA as long a live if there isn’t something done about this.,@erickgoon4729,2024-05-26T17:50:44Z

“Recency Bias” is a real ting my guy!! Who ever dropped last is apparently better lol. But if y’all know Drake you know where this is going!!! The only thing upsetting to me is…I knew some p didn’t like Drake and it’s cool.  But to see everyone wanting to see Kendrick dethrone the God is disheartening. Ppl hate whoever is on top. I seen them do it to Mayweather and others. Ppl actually like the fact Kendrick literally said “I’m the biggest hater”???Like wtf??!!! Regardless of how much ppl claim to love you. Use you to help their personal lives and careers. Deep down they really hate you and pray on your downfall. Watching Drakes career taught me that one.,@muhammad_berkowitz989,2024-05-03T13:41:14Z
Coming back to listen to this after Kendrick verse this don’t hit as hard anymore to me. It’s still not trash though Drake went off. Kendrick is just showing levels to me.,@shonthaphenom4341,2024-05-03T11:17:48Z
Beat ass,@_jizl_,2024-05-03T06:48:15Z
"I don’t know, maybe it’s because he went after so many people in one song, but I think Drake’s response was much better crafted than Dot’s and more interesting. It’s more creative, wittier, more subliminal, had better beats and thus hit harder in my opinion. It gives off a feeling of being a full production track rather than a diss track. Just not seeing what all the hoopla is about with Kendrick.",@AdamSmith-fe9jf,2024-05-03T05:29:12Z
"I didn’t hear this before kendrick responded. I was aware of the situation but didn’t care enough to check on it. But after euphoria I had to see what he was responding to. To be up front, I’m a huge Kendrick fan, and I don’t care for Drake at all. BUT, after listening to this track I gotta be honest… this is even worse than I expected. Drake is a so wack it hurts. Once again he just sounds like an actor reciting rap lyrics. This is trash",@Garrett1989fool,2024-05-03T04:07:00Z
I’m back to say he stole these lyrics from battle rappers and have ghostwriters smh,@jayraxxx2324,2024-05-03T00:45:01Z
The beat is hard tho wait a minute 😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥,@richellemuah,2024-05-02T22:55:53Z
Yall saying drake won because it slaps lol bruh this sounds like crap you cant win because of a beat,@BigBuck86,2024-05-02T22:12:04Z
Drakes song sounds better to the ears but Kendricks song is actually real as fuck. Drake can act hard all he wants and talk all this shit but at the end of the day everyone in the scene knows that lil bro is all bark and no bite and that homie came from canada and had a lil acting career and shit before he ever saw the fame he has now after pretending to be someone he isnt. Drake is not hard. Drake is not from the streets and made himself better. This is why people who have actually been in that life and been through that shit for real dont really care for drake like that. All good to be you but to portray this other character for extra clout or street cred is just beyond cringey now. His music still goes hard but definitely not against people with some real heart and soul behind their music and lyrics.,@KeraClappedYou,2024-05-02T21:23:04Z
That beat carries this song. Anybody with a brain easily would take Kendrick simply on the beat is even better and Kendrick articulated every word he meant. Drake tried to make a hit. Who’s trending #1 right now? Gotta ask the Drake fan goobers 😂,@MrPasta98,2024-05-02T20:24:28Z
Beat carried this shit sound like a youtuber made this😂,@Plutonian-t5f,2024-05-02T15:06:54Z
"After hearing euphoria, i must say this is ssa. Drake has the beat and kendrick bodied with the lyrical. Beat shit can be played out but KENDRICK SPITTED FACTSSSSS .DRAKE IS QUESTIONABLE WHEN IT COMES TO BEING HOMO ETC SO I MEAN HE DIDNT LIE, HE ALSO DIDNT LIE ABOUT THE SON PART AND ALSO GHOST WRITING.",@MaJesticBeLL,2024-05-02T15:01:21Z
"It’s funny that he thought he could beat Kendrick with that shitty non-sense. Kendrick gave him a warning with euphoria, it was just a warm-up. There is one king and one clown. It’s not even a fair fight 😂",@zezetekiroglu,2024-05-02T11:59:27Z
Listening after Kendrick deep fried Drake,@cristianruiz715,2024-05-02T11:52:26Z
Drake so soft as shit. this is trash waste of a beat,@andygarcia433,2024-05-02T06:27:29Z
"All the Kendrick fans came here to hear something that they missed…..nope didn’t miss a thing, Drakes verse is worse after listening to Euphoria 😂😂😂😂",@kenandavis2225,2024-05-02T03:21:47Z
Kendrick shit was wack af maybe it was the beat,@gawdszn302,2024-05-02T01:12:47Z
Came back to make sure I wasnt missing something...I wasn't.  This wasnt even as good as the verse on Like Dat....,@jerometruitt2731,2024-05-01T23:50:21Z
After listening to euphoria.. the best thing about Drake's diss track is the beat I'm sorry it's all nursery rhyme compared to KDOT,@Philgent15,2024-05-01T23:49:07Z
Kendrick cooked him 😂 drakes is catchy but diss tracks need to have diss component and kendrick has that by 100x.,@TheFatcake1234,2024-05-01T23:30:17Z
The beat is tuff other then that THIS IS ASSSSSS TF,@DrizzyBo1,2024-05-01T23:19:03Z
This version is sooo ass... STRICTLY cause of the beat,@SupaFlyyKidd11,2024-05-01T21:23:44Z
This is the better diss+song. No one wants to listen to a 40 year old force a high pitched goblin voice,@ebzs1429,2024-05-01T21:20:56Z
This is as hard as Drake can go. He’s cut out for making catchy songs… He cannot battle a real rapper like Kendrick.,@cleen1986,2024-05-01T19:58:51Z
"""And you gon' feel the aftermath of what I write down"" - bruh we know you don't write your own lyrics 😭",@GalántaiBenedek,2024-05-01T19:21:54Z
There are couple lines in here that are good NGl. but imo doesn’t even match the like that verse. Imo the aggression lacks the bars are not near the level of 40 secs of violence. I’ll give Aubrey credit he and his ghost writers came up with some ish..but then euphoria came out.,@Aka326,2024-05-01T19:14:39Z
Kendrick got this one beat with euphoria 👏💯,@destineealexis8045,2024-05-01T15:01:39Z
Kendrick copy and paste everything we already knew about drakebn put it on a beat😅.,@mach30,2024-05-01T14:25:41Z
I dont like this beat it ruins it for me 🤷🏾,@haljordan4358,2024-05-01T14:23:18Z

Drake's flow sends me to sleep 😴 its so repetitive like the rest of his music - everything he does sound the same.,@sharparts8637,2024-05-01T13:11:12Z
ONE OF THE WORST DISS TRACKS IN HISTORY OF HUMANITY,@LIIIIIFE,2024-05-01T09:27:18Z
So how is this beating Kendrick diss,@Kdot4742,2024-05-01T09:26:04Z

The only thing Hard about this track after hearing Euphoria is the Beat,@9ine986,2024-05-01T04:46:40Z
Euphoria better…Drake talking getting his nails done while Kendrick nailing him in the coffin for being a dead beat dad(still) even after Pusha T had to make him start trying to act like one in the first place,@jawaramars1922,2024-05-01T04:30:35Z
The beat 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭,@_emophobia,2024-05-01T03:19:53Z
I think he might have Kendrick beat sorry not sorry,@Corbin_Forrester,2024-05-01T02:08:18Z
This just a lil catchy. Kendrick murdered him. Tbh,@TacticalTech-,2024-05-01T01:16:09Z
Why couldnt kendrick have cadence like drake? His bars on this type beat with better cadence and hed have won it.,@Flicky_doodle,2024-05-01T00:43:17Z
Kdot track cuts deeper than Drakes,@kochise1119,2024-05-01T00:28:00Z
This is awful.,@pauls9034,2024-04-30T23:42:53Z
Whoever thinks this beats euphoria is a d rider for drake this shit is soft as heck. Kendrick will end drake’s career by time this beef over,@PrblmSolver_93,2024-04-30T20:43:37Z
I think this beat is better but what Kendrick said is way more potent,@ignorantenlightenment,2024-04-30T20:04:34Z
"So, this song is more catchy but Euphoria was more cutting which matters more In a beef. Round goes to Kendrick",@SlammedHams,2024-04-30T18:53:01Z
This is simple compared to what Kendrick just put out. Euphoria sounds better and lyrics hit harder,@ChronicTheHempHog-mf3nh,2024-04-30T17:06:00Z
"I'm not surprised that Kendrick rapped better that was a given, but with all Drake's ties I'm surprised Dot's beats was so much better.",@EnRaiter14,2024-04-30T16:41:43Z

no one can top kendrick's verse on like that not even kendrick himself,@Josh_hutcherson007,2024-04-28T04:13:02Z
There are a few country boys that did this beat justice. This was subpar at best. I wonder who his ghost writers are.,@tommydee2470,2024-04-28T01:26:28Z

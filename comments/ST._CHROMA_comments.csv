That beat switch is so cool,@siraveryknowsitall4581,2025-03-19T14:48:47Z
Ok I know that perhaps the intent of “I never had a doubt inside me and if I ever told you that I’m f*cking lying” is meant ((maybe)) to be like arrogant. But personally I see it as kind of lying to ones self like deep down you probably know you will be safe and happy but its the cards your dealt that make you doubt your ability but you are capable,@incognitospaghet1452,2025-03-17T16:38:27Z

A couple weeks ago I was in my computing class sitting next to my friend. 4 some reason I started to sing this song quietly in my mind but then my friend also started to sing along and we were getting louder and louder and we even started to hit our legs on the floor to the beat. I'm not sure why but I feel like this is that type of memories that stays with you forever throughout your life. Just wanted to tell y'all a funny story.,@Realfreakguy,2025-02-13T13:07:29Z

"Now, don’t get me wrong, the production quality and music quality; godsend. But can we appreciate the unconventional, uncomfortable feeling St. Chroma’s (as in the Tyler persona) entire existence gives, he’s dressed from the neck down on a suit and dress shoes, but is wearing a creepy smooth, uncanny valley mask.

"One day, you wake up and recognize the need for a new Tyler, The Creator album — not merely as music, but as a source of inspiration across multiple facets of life. His work defies predictability, offering profound insights even in tracks crafted for mainstream appeal. Tyler’s deliberate and often unconventional artistic choices not only enhance creative expression but also provoke deeper philosophical reflection. It’s inevitable that his oeuvre will soon be studied in academic contexts—spanning music theory, poetry, philosophy, contemporary art, visual identity, art direction, and cinematography.",@baba123776,2024-10-23T06:49:51Z

"I am really surprised that no one is talking about the art direction and the look harkening back to the 1927 film Metropolis and the look of the images. Also, it brings to mind elements of Blade Runner and the underlining sounds at the base of the music...Also, gives off a ver 1984 Orwell vibe too. Very Neo dystopian feel like someone looking inside questioning others looking for something more...Just thinking out loud...I am most likely wrong)))",@TeddBurns,2024-10-21T18:42:02Z

"I believe that Tyler's new character is called Chroma The Great. This is because in the movie, The Phantom Toolbooth, Chroma the great is a character whos main job is to conduct sunlight, sunset and sunrise, which all has one main theme: Colour. My theory is that Chroma The Great (Tyler) is leading his soldiers into this crate which he exploded because the soldiers death (at least in this universe/trailer) creates colour. Thats why Chroma The Great exploded the crate. The soldiers deaths create colour. Also not sure about this last bit, but maybe why the last guy is slightly behind all of the soldiers and is not in unity is because he possibly wants to revolt against Chroma The Great. Once again, just a theory.",@stchroma1,2024-10-18T15:44:07Z

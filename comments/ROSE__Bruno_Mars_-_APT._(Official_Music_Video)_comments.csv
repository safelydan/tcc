"*Song title* ""Lost in Memories"" *Song lyrics* Verse 1: In the shadows of my mind I see your face, I feel your shine Memories of our love, they linger on A bittersweet reminder of what we had, what we've gone Chorus: Oh, I'm lost in memories of you Forever trapped in the love we once knew I'm looking for a way to break free But your memory stays with me Verse 2: Summer nights, we danced under the stars Our love was pure, our hearts beating as one from afar But like the seasons, our love did fade Leaving me with just a memory, a love that's been delayed Chorus: Oh, I'm lost in memories of you Forever trapped in the love we once knew I'm looking for a way to break free But your memory stays with me Bridge: Time may heal, but it won't erase The love we share, the memories we've made In my heart, you'll always stay A love that's lost, but never fades away Chorus: Oh, I'm lost in memories of you Forever trapped in the love we once knew I'm searching for a way to break free But your memory stays with me *Musical Style* This song can be made in a more relaxed and emotional musical style, such as a ballad or pop ballad. By using instruments such as piano, acoustic guitar, and strings, this song can create a more intimate and emotional atmosphere.",@MFA-f8q,2025-03-17T02:36:37Z

Love the friendly vibe of Rosé and Bruno together ❤,@davidbasco1,2025-03-03T11:49:46Z
"For anyone confused, ""Apateu"" is actually a Korean drinking game, and the name comes from the English word ""apartment."" The chorus rhythm is the same as the chant in the game where people shout, ""apateu apateu, apateu apateu,"" before starting. So, there’s some clever wordplay with the lyrics ""meet me at the apateu (apartment)."" The intro is also a reference to the ""Random Game,"" where the loser of the last round picks the next game to play, and in this case, Rosé chose to play ""Apateu."" I think she was trying to incorporate that fun and wild Korean drinking culture vibe and energy into the song",@Jason_wassu,2025-03-03T00:13:40Z

I don't care how much backlash I get but you can't make a country song with cuss words in it. Sorry Beyonce but that's not how country rolls. Also this in my opinion is worst song I ever heard from her. No hate just stay in your lane (btw the way before you say this is racist im black)  I like country the way is no cussing. You can't call it a country song if there's cussing in it. If you look at all the country songs there's not one cuss word in them. Stay with the hip hop genre.,@Oboroshirakumo342,2025-03-06T19:38:21Z

"I do not care for country, nor do I care for these nasty comments. But because I grew up around country, I know when I hear a catchy country tune. I love this… it may not be your normal to the others, but I am very appreciative of your flexibility with music, it gives me a new perspective.  This is a beautiful piece that you sang your heart out to, and I feel like more people should appreciate it for just what it is. 🔥💚🔥",@sowapuss1174,2025-03-02T01:55:53Z

"I do not listen to country that much but this is not country.. The country is about the singer, not the instruments. Beyonce sings like a pop artist, even in this and her lyrics are dull because she can not sing country.. She did not put much effort in to adding the quirks that country singers are doing to make their songs sound like country. Beyonce won because she is famous and are in a good position with the once who decide who will win or not. It is dumb how famous artists just ride the wave once they get famous and get praised for mediocre stuff. Songs like these are a humiliation towards those who live and breathe country when they are robbed out of awards that should be theirs.",@JeEhaO,2025-02-10T10:01:10Z

Some of my favorite songs include Levi jeans, Protector, Riverdance, Yaya, Tyrant II Most Wanted, Bodyguard, Blackbird, 16 carriages, and Texas Hold 'Em, not to mention spaghetti.

"I’ve never been a fan of Beyoncé, but this song can easily get lost in your head, and you can’t shake it. Besides that, I do have to say this.  Experimenting with different genres can help, until you find your voice, all new singers that break out into the music scene do this.  But for Beyoncé who’s been doing R&B, pop and hip hop music for as long as she has to jump ship to country is a big leap. Her voice is a powerhouse in the other genres of music and that’s been her vibe for all of her musical life. It’s great she’s expanding her repertoire and trying her hand at Country, and  Country musicians welcomed her with open arms to the country music  family.  But with her vocals mixing with country music is an absolute long shot. I admit country music isn’t what it used to be, it’s a little more poppy, but there some artist’s that love to go back to the traditional ways of what country music use to be. But in the case of Miss Beyoncé, there are already Country Queens. I’d rather her be in the zone where she has been labeled a queen in her more recognized career.",@ashleye.3131,2024-11-04T10:32:58Z

I love this song. Some of the country music these days is terrible and stupid. This song is definitely country. Beyoncé has always been a country girl. She still has her southern accent. Whoever is casting her out A) hasn’t listened to the whole song. The banjo was awesome. She actually sang about southern things not some stupid country pop song like these dudes. Miranda lambert vibes. I’m white and I love her and I am happy she did this bc this needed to happen to bring the haters out. When a black man came out in country they didn’t care.

Okay so I have been listening to a lot of country music and the problem with what Beyonce's doing here is the stuff that she's talking about has no integrity at all. Country music is much deeper than the shallow stuff she's talking about here in this song.

"This is thrilling. Everything we could have wanted from her new era - it feels like all previous eras of Gaga are present on this record - we hear the virtuoso pianist, the rock star, the pop star, the jazz vocalist taking risks, the dark synth queen … and a totally unique artistic voice - one that can look at the whole of humanity good and bad and deliver something of beauty - with depth and emotional range and yet the same time - also still, to put simply - a catchy hook laden pop song! No one can touch her! Thrilling!",@st3vi3,2024-10-26T19:53:42Z

I can't stop listening to it! The vocal lines she creates amplify the powerful feeling of this song. Lady Gaga isn’t just a singer; she’s a multi-instrumentalist and songwriter. No one else can move from jazz to this genre with such results. I really wish I could sing like her!!! I just hope I don’t ruin this song when I make my cover...,@veronicashovel7099,2024-10-26T16:34:05Z

The raw, campy and passionate vocals, like a rock or metal song, the epicness of the adlibs and the harmonies, the heavy and hard as fuck synth pop or industrial rock instrumental(its giving me 2000s vibes, kinda like Marilyn Manson-esque, the spooky lyrics, the overall Halloween-ish vibe to it, the darkness of it all, it's so precious, it's giving Government Hooker, Heavy Metal Lover and BTW in general vibes, but in a more edgy and chaotic and thriller movie way, I love it. It's so Gaga🖤🤩✨",@andynaveda,2024-10-26T04:56:05Z

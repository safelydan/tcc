He didn’t have to do much for a video because anyone can visualize the whole bar scene in their minds as the song plays… oh and clearly country music originated as a diversion from blues, which was created by the original man.

"I was introduced to this song in my line dance class. It's addictive!  I wanted to learn the lyrics so that I could  sing along to it properly, so I went online and have endeavoured to memorize them. To me, it's a blues song  in a country wrapping: The premise is that he is driven-to-drink by the expectations of his woman, who wants a Birkin handbag, gasoline, groceries, et cetera. Birkins are purses made by the House of Hermes in France and the design was named for actress Jane Birkin, the expat Brit who moved to Paris, France and ensconced herself into Parisian culture through her art as well as through her relationship with singer Serge Gainsbourg. Birkin bags are ExTrEmElY expensive and exclusive (average price is between $10, 400  and $2, 000,000).

"This song is catchy. It has an upbeat vibe and is very easy to tap your foot to. The singer's voice is charming and rasping away that invites your sustained attention. That being said, the song is a bit repetitive and doesn't have very dynamic lyrics. It seems like it just repeats the chorus or refrain over again. The lyrics are so simple that you actually feel like you're at a bar tipsy close to falling asleep. I would say that this song is okay for a first listen, but any listens after the first and you're bound to fall asleep by its repetitiveness.",@Purple_Cat_97,2024-12-19T15:31:37Z

I just don't think it's country. It's got acoustic guitar and violin. But that doesn't make it county. It's just a drinking song. All the group singing. And you need a southern accent to be country too. I'll read any explanations. I just don't get why it was even considered for country. like I'd put it in the same category of joy to the world by three dog night. Just a great pop rock hit,@kyleterrell6842,2024-11-25T13:40:02Z

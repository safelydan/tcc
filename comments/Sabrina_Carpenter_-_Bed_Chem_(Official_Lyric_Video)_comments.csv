"Sabrina should really switch lanes  to R&B. This is tha only song I can tolerate of hers. Espresso sounds just like Flowers by Miley or Happy by Pharrell. Over commercialized pop garbage. But Bed Chem has like early 2000’s/late 90’s R&B vibes. Plus, with her making music like this, she REALLY shouldn’t be gearing her other songs towards tweens and lil girls. I saw her concert footage. Looked like a strip club.",@Whothisis1,2025-02-17T19:10:59Z

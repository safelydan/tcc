"I’m already calling it as of July 1, 2024 that he finna fall off so hard. He’s a one hit wonder no offense to his fans and to everyone that seems to like the “catchy hook” or the “beat”. The lyrics aren’t even that good tbh, just being real with yall. But yeah I’m calling it yall, bro either finna fall off hella quick after this one hit, or he going to hire ghost writers to keep making him songs to stay relevant in order so he can continue making bags of money. Money talks so if he hires ghost writers he can easily make more money to keep paying them. But if the songs are just terrible, than nothing will save him.",@kevinanton6797,2024-07-02T01:37:16Z

"i used to think she was saying ""with cankles"" and that's what initially made me like the song because i thought she was being funny and self-deprecating. but when i found it was ""work angles"" my mind was blown! i realized she literally worked the angles of those words to make it sound like a different phrase. it's so cool and i wonder if she had the intent to do that. either way i love the song no matter what, just thought it was funny how what drew me to it was mishearing the lyrics.",@justforjacob,2025-02-25T19:16:12Z

Her voice is magical. Ever since Boom Clap I've just felt that her voice carries this energy. It's almost like even when she's belting out lyrics she's taking a bracing breath in as if she were about to jump off a high dive or something. That doesn't really make sense but it's the best way I can describe her voice. I'd venture to say that I'm not really her target demographic but I f*cking love this album and especially this song.,@royjones8312,2025-01-03T01:20:51Z

"Not to maaajorly over-analyze, but that model expression is so unique to me. It gives the vibe that she's breaking the 4th wall, aware of the chaos around her, and still acting like she's currently posing for a magazine. It feels like she's still there as a full human person, like we're almost there, and she's not being just an idea or concept or character, she's human but still tapping into a boss part of herself. I think it's unique because most modelly expressions look detached and/or beyond their current situation and tend not to be grounded. I especially love it with the wine chaos going on - she's blinking wildly but she's still slaying. She keeps looking like she's battling the elements, even when there aren't elements to fight, and it's just so cool. Video modelling fr",@katara9,2024-07-18T15:05:18Z

Great song! I miss hearing Charli's real voice though. She has such a cool voice! I'm sick of the robot vocal effect on every song now. It was cool for the hyperpop period but now I miss the real voice.

Please someone explain to me how this song has the views it does? What about this song is good? The generic beat? The terrible lyrics? The “woke” vibe to it? This song couldnt be anywhere further from reality and from real music. This is just selling s** to young children and nothing else. You cannot sing darling. Whoever produced this song needs a change of career. The photographers and videographers need serious counselling. From the ads of this song i just knew it was gonna be some wasteful nonesense.

Ariana Grande - could have done better with her career - this track is a decent house track throwback to a great time in dance music in the 90s - but the lyrics and content that ariana grande puts forward is clearly sexual predator shit written by men - its dissappointing that she allows herself to be the vehicle to push this crap in to the psyche of our younger generation. DEGENERATE generation.. great track.. shitty lyrics,@ChrisNova777,2025-03-01T19:56:54Z

"Anyone else noticed how the MV has subtle references from previous LG‚Äôs masterpieces?

"Loving EVERYTHING about THIS. Not only - it's actually the first time I watch this video-, that when I heard this tune some months back, that I paid attention to Ariana's music.. probably just really only knowing the collaboration with The Weekend, before. However, watching the video now & paying attention to the song's composition elements, it's so beautiful to see how she pays tribute to Paula Abdul's ""Cold Hearted"" in terms of choreography set up & execution - which back then, was actually a choreography tribute to Bob Fosse. ü•∞. You will know, it's a definite tribute to Paula Abdul's video, when you see the window blinds go up to darken the dance studio at 2:25, when in Paula's video, the blinds get pulled down to darken the dance studio from 02:17-02:24. But also, the song actually seems to incredibly cleverly sample George Michael's beginning intro from ""Freedom 90'"" - just sped up & masterly cut into a fraction. So. But then also, culminating into beats resembling Madonna's ""Vogue"" just changed. Which would state the case, when the clay figures from 0:47-049 show Vogueing poses.. . So, And Yes.. is a lil masterpiece in its whole contribution & homage to other artists. Well done. ü•∞",@magicdragicfilms,2024-11-28T01:05:41Z

"Eternal sunshine is such a great album; so many references to other artists, both her peers and other, former divas.

I was going to have my performers that I love who appeal to me. And today (June 4, 2004) I have found it. Ariana won a new fan today. Me. I have listened to the first few lines of the lyrics to songs from stars like Shawn Mendes and I switched off. Ariana's song's just make me want to keep on listening. Nothing to do with the fact that two very young victims of the tragedy in Manchester are from my hometown. There is something about her voice that just keeps me hooked. I intend to listen to more in the very near future. This is my first ever song. But there is going to me more. Much more.",@paulanderson1962,2024-06-04T18:13:41Z

"Really funny and catchy song, Ariana is always giving us good surprises",@patriciacrowley1103,2024-03-24T22:24:34Z
"Ariana remains at the top of her game regardless of critics and undeserving hate, she's a true artist, natural singer and actress, she's really just at the beginning of her career and will continue to do nothing but to continue her reign full of bangers and great vocals. Love her.",@antoniohuitron7296,2024-03-24T18:43:09Z
"Remember ""One Kiss"" by Calvin Harris and Dula Peep? I used to say that that song game me _massive_ Abercrombie & Fitch vibes back in early 2018 when it came out... and a bunch of people agreed with me LOL! This also sounds like something I would hear blasting over the loudspeakers in A&F or Hollister while I'm overstimulated by cologne and shirtless male models... which, come to think of it, doesn't sound like a bad time at all! üòù BRB we going shopping! üõçüíÉüèæü™©üéµ",@meechmushrooms,2024-03-24T18:33:07Z

"Ngl when it came to her music, listening to her voice afterwhile got old as her voice is monotone, and she talks about the same shit in every single video, does ass twerking, and uses her body for marketing. Any real artist would say that isn't how you should be making your fame, although I'm not one to hate because she's getting her money, but its still bad. Why do I listen to her thoughh? It's been the beat to her songs, and are the only thing saving them and making it fire.",@Angxl3333,2024-11-19T02:04:45Z

"All her songs sound the damn same. Very first time even giving them a click just to see if she's as horrible as ppl are saying she is in droves .. & I can confirm. LmAO. Her voice is so dreadfully monotone as well; it's irritating. I'm sure there is still some good, even great, & outstanding new rap and hiphop talent out there, but it's being washed away and drowned out by this atrocious mess. God-leeeeee.",@TheBestCommenteronYouTube,2024-10-08T04:42:12Z
The beat is absolutely immaculate but Ice Spices verse brings it down.,@prestonangel448,2024-10-07T23:25:39Z
1:04 by the end of this verse ill be done,@2huugo374,2024-10-07T17:44:58Z
Okay yes the lyrics aren't at all groundbreaking but shit they are both riding the beat especially Central Cee (which makes sense because this is more of a UK hip hop beat) . Listen to the beat alone and you kinda miss the vibe they both bring. You aren't meant to get inspired just bob your head around shake your ass and keep it moving. Not every song needs to be about serious thought provoking stuff gosh. Shake you ass and relax. Honestly the only song of hers I enjoy and have on repeat.,@thandeka9454,2024-10-07T16:44:38Z

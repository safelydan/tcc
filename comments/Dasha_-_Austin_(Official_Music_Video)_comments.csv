"I am deeply annoyed. Long ago my generation called this ""bordello-style."" Now I would call it ""Stripper-tattoed Style"". Did you not see the poor story and the clowns acting like pimp and his pimpernelia? Who cares, if an overdosed alcoholic tattoe bearer would change the attitudes or localities? who cares if a stripper dances here or there in shimmering light, cause she would not see during her career daylight anyhow? I can t bear all these spitting images anymore and I can t even bear people who are not only accepting, but energetic defending this crap. You are the best customers of strip clubs, or, as Sopranos told us, bada bing, bada bang. Disgusting!!!",@rudigerbacker9250,2025-03-14T09:53:10Z

Absolutely great song. Love country from all generations. She got that Shaina Twain and Laney Wilson vibe. Unfortunately none of her other music sounds like this and frankly isn't all that great.

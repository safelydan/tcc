It's a knife when some random ass dude said the original version was better... Are we even listening to the same lyrics? Yo wtf hahaha,@neil4121,2025-02-07T06:51:08Z

"This song isn't only iconic, it's very relatable too. Some people just be saying things, acting sympathic and all but they truly only want the worst for you.",@ilovechai2520,2024-12-04T15:46:20Z
Definitely the worst song of 2024 by far.,@1223-k5r,2024-11-30T08:25:59Z
"""It's a knife when you know they're counting on you mistakes"" these lyrics is so relatable to my life at school cuz my "" friend"" backstabbed me",@et3rn4lsunsh1ne,2024-11-24T11:31:20Z
This is the kind of song you hear once and can't stop! The two artists created such a unique vibe. 'Sympathy Is a Knife' is everything! 💯🎉,@Mundo_dos_desenhos45,2024-11-22T13:46:28Z
This song is making my heart beat faster! Charli XCX and Ariana Grande's voices complement each other in such an amazing way. Pure perfection! ✨,@Mundo_Pony,2024-11-22T13:41:43Z

I love this song. These lyrics are reminding me of Lisa like she's getting hate for  everything she's doing.,@Simi_946,2024-10-19T14:44:56Z
Such an awful song,@narwanhy3177,2024-10-18T09:35:47Z

"The end of the original remix should be maintained, Ari’s beats and hidden vocals are perfect!!",@rosamatosz,2024-10-14T16:30:35Z
Love you Ariana so much been a fan since Manchester and everything else after that have cp please be respectful tight chest legs  neck shoulders just everything hurts right now your music has helped me a lot especially your later stuff  also I think I have a little bit of a bug right now sore head years and jumpy chest  also don’t let the tabloids control  you don’t listen you know who you are and who you are deep inside and they don’t don’t like them at all at all  i’m so glad you opened up about that I wil always be there for you no matter what they say ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,@Aydan2002kqy,2024-10-13T22:44:56Z
AG and easy fun are seriously the OG COOKs. Period. The vocal layers and that high note arpeggio is such a unique and ethereal melody structure. Aris voice worked well with the robotic auto tune effect. So many gems to this piece love it,@elishamiyahira4301,2024-10-13T08:20:22Z
THANK U NEXT VIBES,@shourisfly,2024-10-12T23:29:09Z

El vocal de ari no se puede ocultar es literalmente hermoso,@AntonioAlcantara-yv7wv,2024-10-12T13:05:20Z
Am I the only one who things this song is giving 2014 vibezzz,@rollymz,2024-10-12T05:06:10Z
Unpopular opinion Ari lower register is over hyped 😳 She sounds best her higher notes not Ari trying to go low like Billie isn't the best I think Billie should have been on this while Ariana was on Guess,@YouStankGoEat,2024-10-12T04:44:28Z
ariana's background vocals and adlibs are the best things in the world!!,@vebyfachrudin,2024-10-12T00:32:52Z
This is the worst song I have ever heard and I love the og song 🥲,@Lookischmooki,2024-10-11T23:36:13Z
Fact about ARIANA GRANDE she will hop on any album and slayyyy every verse. Don't sayyy anythinggggggg. Bye,@Imrong_10,2024-10-11T21:00:39Z
"ariana's lyrics are ass XD omg, this is charli's album not hers....it sounds like lyrics ment for her album that talks exactly about the same thing which also has ass lyrics...im sorry, this was a miss for me.",@metanoiia_,2024-10-11T19:39:30Z
This lyrics are very personal and I understand.🥲😭💖,@AriiTw1,2024-10-11T18:45:09Z
"I didn't like it at first listen since I was disappointed since I wanted the original beat, but somehow after a few times listening I fell in love with it.",@pedromachado3109,2024-10-11T17:13:11Z
This stinks. Sympathy is a Knife is the standout track on Brat for me. The melody is gone now. Just make a new song you lazy shook ass dorks,@yesthatjake5601,2024-10-11T14:54:22Z
Kylie minogue - too much 2010 vibes … love it …,@AliMeade_89,2024-10-11T14:38:53Z
yall need to listen to these lyrics and LEARN FROM THEM!!!!!!!! stop talking shit about these pop girls...they go through enough.,@xtcharmed,2024-10-11T13:37:09Z
1:03 Is where ari’s verse starts… I think,@AdrianaTall-b5h,2024-10-11T13:36:46Z
"For all those whining about wanting Ari to just hop on the original SIAK and just add a verse, not only is that boring, but it wouldn't work. That song is about a specific person, and that person is NOT Ari.",@Sai-pf4ft,2024-10-11T13:28:09Z
Please say this remind you of Arianas verse on I don’t do drugs,@krystal_Versace,2024-10-11T13:07:41Z
"The vocal layering and adlibs of ariana is fucking insane, takes the song to different level. Like just listen to the adlib of ""on top"" at 1:32. Just perfection",@PrakharMishra-ww8kq,2024-10-11T12:39:31Z
"I love that these remixes are ACTUAL remixes, and not just added verses. We got a totally new album and I'm here for it!",@mikaylierae8659,2024-10-11T12:38:53Z
"Need more beat, Actually",@WillM12-o3m,2024-10-11T12:25:45Z
2:01 How ironic that Charli exceeded my expectations in this verse. I love this part I wish it was longer,@tiredoftiredness,2024-10-11T11:43:10Z
Lyrics are great here but the beat of the first version is sick! Liked that better,@israeljunior8601,2024-10-11T11:05:16Z
so good. so nostalgic.,@ckgnproductions8338,2024-10-11T10:47:37Z

"Charli, dito isso, o remix podetia ter sido igual a música original, queria ouvir a ariana cantando o refrão, nada vê esse remix ai, perda de tempo, deixasse a coitada da ariana divulgar o filme dela.",@Clara.demiciano,2024-10-11T09:49:55Z
"2024 is really the year for Ariana to showcase her  talent in different genre like house, synth pop, R&B, opera, ballad, hyper pop and experimental pop as well.",@zeit_guise,2024-10-11T09:31:54Z
1:18 This beat is so Robyn “In My Eyes” love it,@sarahwilson976,2024-10-11T08:51:56Z
"This really takes me back to when I was big on twitter and the same people that ""loved"" me (often to the point of sexual harassment) decided to switch up and cancel me just to feel better about themselves. I even faced catfish allegations lol. These lyrics are too personal.",@feeb4007,2024-10-11T08:49:02Z
The synth goes crazy,@CloudAuraAngel,2024-10-11T08:05:43Z

"Sprained my finger clicking on this so fast. Was not disappointed. This is what remixes are supposed to be. Adding to the creativity of the original not just slipping in one extra verse before the bridge.

Idk how to feel. I wanted to at least hear Ariana sing the chorus. I'm not trying to get ate up by dick riders/keyboard gangsters so I'll stop there. I expected a teeny bit more out of them that is all...,@93945mike,2024-10-11T04:46:29Z

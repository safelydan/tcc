"Nikola Tesla said “If you only understood the significance of the numbers 3,6,9 you would have the keys to understanding the universe” Earth is the 3rd planet in distance from the sun, Saturn is the 6th, and Pluto is the 9th. Can someone please help me understand how can I use this information to enhance and enrich my earthly existence the way this song enhances my emotional state? Before I move onto other realms I want the absolute best of this one, is that too much to ask for? I want to increase my “goodness threshold” but I need material wealth to do so. The goodness threshold is how good can things get for you before you sabotage it by your own thoughts that this is too good to be true so a tragedy must be looming the horizons. How good can this song be before I hate it for being so good? Please help me understand🥹",@kaseymarcelle007,2024-11-03T17:59:02Z

I always stick tot he people that don’t really care about me that much, and I always wonder why I’m still there. But I know it’s because of my fear of losing everyone, so I just want to find someone who cares about me. The lyrics ‘I’ll be better on Saturn, none of this matters, dreaming of Saturn’ reminds me of how I’m dreaming of finding someone that understands me, so I’m just waiting for that day.

"Okay, here is the story. SZA is the real deal as a singer, not sure if you write your songs and music but i would say lyrics would be your forte. This style suits you (even if it borrows from the Bee Gees). You are about the only refreshing popular artist that has a sound all to yourself. I listen to thousand of songs each year from the complete unknown to the top (payola) artists with all their backing and not many put out good songs, certainly not consistently like you SZA.

"It subtly interpolates the opening hook of the Bee Gee’s “Too Much Heaven”. It’s in the background at small breaks, hummed as a melody by either her backing vocals or her own vocals backing her.

All ik asking is a chance and I'll treat you better than anyone you've ever encountered your entire life. Your beauty is like a art and your personality is perfect and different from others. But one thing I ask from you is to stop posting on social media bc ur mine and only mine. I'm the only one who is supposed to show you love and affection and you won't accept that. So stop playing hard to get baby bc I know you want me. look bae im not trying to be overprotected and abusive or some shit but you fine asf and im tryna make you mine babe.

"The sweet and ethereal sound of her singing is discordant with the deeply Satanic nihilism embedded in the lyrics.

Getting S vibes,@ededdandeddytv5164,2024-03-08T10:15:12Z
Beautiful song. Though the lyrics are a misnomer.  First world problems of very powerful matriarchal toxic women lamenting “love” choices predicated on material goals.,@earthmeetsmoon,2024-03-07T22:35:08Z

"Saturn sounds like ""that urn"" and the lyrics sound like someone sick of this life and wishing to end it. 😶",@jemimabiananila6033,2024-03-04T02:44:22Z
"people are saying that the chorus doesnt sound dreamy anymore, but personally i think it fills out the song more",@brokendreqms,2024-03-04T02:07:51Z

"Sza I love you, but the melody in the ""I´ll be better on saturn..."" part in the grammy performance is what made this song so special and beautiful, this version for me lacks all that magic",@samuelgomezrodriguez3172,2024-02-25T00:12:36Z
"even though you changed the pitch, I still love you Sza and im so excited for LANA❤❤",@hersha777,2024-02-24T23:02:51Z
I’m sorry but the Mastercard was so much better I need the higher pitch and the lyric I can’t break this pattern is better than not to break this pattern,@andrewjackson4336,2024-02-24T21:52:04Z
“Life is better on Saturn” HER VOCALS ARE EVERYTHING,@Hearts4alo,2024-02-24T18:16:58Z
Saturn is actually what keeps us trapped in this awful paradigm ironically,@mkpsyops,2024-02-24T17:58:56Z
I can’t be the only one trying hard to like this version. The unreleased version just had a more magical feel to it. She also changed the lyrics from “I can’t break this pattern” to “Got to break this pattern”. The high pitched “I’ll be better on Saturn” was changed as well and the “wooh oh” before”life’s better on Saturn” on the second verse.,@KimHongjoong11,2024-02-24T16:52:53Z

"The mixing on this version is a mistake btw, sza said this will be fixed soon",@zenzenxo,2024-02-24T08:17:59Z
The lyrics are so deep. Saturn = Satan. The God of time.  Saturn materialize all life form.,@romel4761,2024-02-24T00:34:58Z
Why she change some of the lyrics :((( the performance was soooo goooood. She needs to release that version,@Hesoweird,2024-02-23T22:59:08Z

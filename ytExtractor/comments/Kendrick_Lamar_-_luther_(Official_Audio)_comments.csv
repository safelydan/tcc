"Man the more I listen to this? I understand more. He they said “ if it was up to me? I wouldn’t give the nobody’s no sympathy”. At first I was thinking like that was a shot at ,somebody whoever and they lied that they are saying is nobody like ignore him, etc. But as I listen more ? That’s not what they was saying. They were saying “if it was up to me I wouldn’t give these nobodies no sympathy .I will take away the pain and give them everything”.Powerful. Meaning? Everybody is feeling like they nobody’s? Make them feel seen make them feel equal. Show them that they are just important in this world as everybody else. They goats in my eyes.💯💯💯",@RoderickGarrett-x7h,2025-02-24T05:55:42Z

"SZA’s voice is something special—so rich, soulful, and effortlessly smooth. Every note she sings carries so much emotion, and ‘Luther’ is another masterpiece that showcases her incredible talent. Her lyrics always feel deeply personal yet so relatable, like she’s speaking straight to the soul. The way she blends vulnerability with confidence in her music is unmatched. She keeps proving why she’s one of the best artists of our generation. Pure artistry!",@Loltastic1,2025-02-17T15:18:29Z

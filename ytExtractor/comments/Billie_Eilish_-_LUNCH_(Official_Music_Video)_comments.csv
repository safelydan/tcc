"Everyone wondering why she didn't win album of the year, this is the EXACT reason. This song is dogshit😂the lyrics especially. People are talking about her ""lyrical genius"" this is why she didn't win any awards. Should've just kept this one or released it seperate from the album. Writing a song about eating a girl out is literally how you ruin a piece of music. Not talking about the song itself but the fact it was paired withe the rest of the album. The song would be better MUSICALLY if it was released with just the music💯or seperate from the album. Her lyrics and just verse in general ruins what was a good composition of music🤷‍♂️",@hantakage,2025-02-05T12:27:29Z

"Back in the 80s ASU and Tempe were very conservative.  I returned for a PhD in 2021 as an old Gen X guy.  The place has gone far left and woke for politics relative to the 80s.  This song reminds me of the modern youth culture in Tempe - very woke with blurred sexual identities across the progressive ""rainbow"" spectrum.  As a moderately conservative Catholic, I am fully aware I am an old guy out-of-place with that scene.  So, I just walk around campus as if HR has a drone flying over me and focus on my dissertation and courses.  But that song really hits the campus vibe these days - a far cry from the 80s with duets like Olivia Newton John and Cliff Richard in ""Suddenly"".",@manuelsteele7755,2024-09-27T16:53:45Z

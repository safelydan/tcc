"Am i the only one who only stares at the vid and starts thinking how sad it is to be this girl? Imagine it's not all fun n games where I mean IRL, there are ppl like this out there. Too egoistic to admit tht they've made a bad judgement. Too ego to admit n too scared of being told ""i told u so"" at their face. Bcs of the ego and embarrassment, they let themselves suffer in the long run, stay in a toxic relationship. I get it MV wont make the song look deep but this situation is actually depressing. Im just speechless staring at my phone's screen thinking how stressful all these situations are. Sorry dont intend to be a buzz killer. I hate my deep thinking brain too. Sorry to whoever read this.

"I am def not the target demo for Sabrina Carpenter as a middle aged woman that primarily listens to electronica. This song is really good. The lyrics nail a very specific feeling that can happen in toxic relationships. I'll speak for myself here:  In a past toxic relationship,  was able to look away from lots of things to an extent. I could compartmentalize the bruising of my ego and heartbreak from the public embarrassment and blow to my reputation that comes with a partners bad behavior. I can't recall another song that has hit that real specific feeling. The lyrics are cleverly crafted and elevated with the bits of twang that come through. I had never heard this song outside of background music until her tiny desk show. That performance really highlighted the Country aspects of the songs she was playing, and what turned me onto this song specifically. She reminds me a little bit of Dolly in the best way possible. And now that I'm hearing this version of the song it's like a synthed out Dolly which is really cool. I never would've thought that kind of combination would work. Her harmonies are luscious too. This song has been burned into my brain for the last 72 hours. It scratches the right itches.",@kassandrakid9440,2024-12-27T08:14:52Z

"I'm typically a pop fan tbh and I like Sabrina's voice, but this song is incredibly irritating. I think being embarrassed of your partner has gotta be one of the biggest red flags imo. And listenting to this song makes me actively cringe because it just reminds me of incredibly toxic people who only use others as a way to prop themselves up. ""If you don't fit into the friend group, you're embarrassing and I'd rather you stay in"", mean girl ass behavior. And the tone just makes it seem like she couldn't give a shit less what would make him happy or what she likes about him as a person, it's just ""well you're my bf now so don't embarrass me"", mc syndrome. This song just makes me think she doesnt want a bf, but a pawn she can just move around her life to show off to others. Like, I genuinely can't imagine a guy making a so called ""love song"" about a girl and the entire song being about how he just doesnt want her to act like herself around his friends because it'll be bad for his image and ego. People would be calling it misogynistic.",@bluntbangs,2024-12-11T22:28:46Z

"To everyone saying this is a cute relationship, the man in the video abandoned his infant and postpartum wife to be with Sabrina. This is the Ariana Grande situation again but its mostly ignored because the couple in question is attractive. This deadbeat father is shooting music videos and following this young woman around on tour while the woman he imoregnated had to birth and raise a baby alone. Its not cute. Its evil and exploitative on his part. Sabrina deserves better too",@mrssoup1119,2024-10-24T00:12:34Z

"I spent 19 years of my life as a sex worker, letting my clients molest my nether regions in exchange for drugs, money, and clout on Snapchat. I not only found the pit of despair but also it's bottom and there I stayed thinking this is who I am and this is where I belong. I had resigned myself to this life when I first heard this song. Or maybe it heard my heart crying out for salvation? These lyrics spoke to me in a way I never dreamed possible. The words resonate with me on a spiritual, personal, and philosophical level. It was as if someone had been watching my every move from the shadows (and I'm still not totally convinced that isn't the case) and written a song about my life. I dare say that whoever wrote the lyrics is of one mind with me. The world had broken me but this song changed everything. This song made love to my spirit, nay, my soul because it spoke to the core of me. This is more than just a song, it is my anthem. The soundtrack to my life. A cornucopia of sounds and melodies that saved me. ,",@Trey_v3.3,2024-09-03T16:17:18Z
WORST SONG EVER 💩,@reeceduggan6749,2024-09-03T12:07:10Z
"I hope the final season of Stranger Things use this song, it has that era vibe",@christianjigdugaduga1401,2024-09-02T06:06:09Z
Anybody know the original song to this beat ?,@juanm448,2024-09-02T00:07:54Z
I really hate when there are sound effects in music videos. It just really disrupts the song 😢,@chris_wildlife,2024-09-01T09:58:37Z
"I oddly loved this music video😂 it’s like scary movie vibes, and scream",@parisgenovese777,2024-09-01T07:11:51Z
"I'm 38 n, and this kinda music doesn't resonate with my usual stuff. However, Sabrina does this thing that catches my ear when I hear her songs. She speaks and sings n does this thing that I can't put my finger on. It's unique I'm drawn into her voice n her style of delivery in her songs. The lyrics aren't that sophisticated however that doesn't impact the quality of the song. It's insane her methodology of creating is impressive for someone so new to the industry. Hats off to her 👏 🙌",@Luna24-u3m,2024-09-01T01:30:00Z
"Damn that's an annoying music video. A straight minute of noise, very nice",@kookydookies5023,2024-08-31T14:31:12Z
"The music video ending for ""Skinny Dipping"" is connected to ""Fast Time."" Now, she's applying the ""multiverse"" concept from ""Espresso"" to ""Please Please Please,"" only Sabrina's Thing. 💌💋",@TARLOSlonestar,2024-08-31T13:15:48Z
Really like the production. Great synths,@Sean-me4fv,2024-08-31T11:23:45Z
Message to all girls who like bad boys and think their serial loser boyfriend is just misunderstood: they call that singlet a wife beater for a reason.,@djb3500,2024-08-30T22:07:48Z

I liked the beat matched up with them kicking him,@tonyzambito152,2024-08-30T00:01:32Z

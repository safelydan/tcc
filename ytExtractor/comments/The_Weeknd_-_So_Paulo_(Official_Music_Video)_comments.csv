"I think this song can be seen as a reflection of modern life, where everything seems attractive and liberal but lacks truth and real satisfaction. These emotions, combined with the name “São Paulo” – a city famous for its excitement and prosperity – can represent the contrast between the external appearance and the internal emotions that The Weeknd is experiencing.",@Jim-2rd,2025-02-23T15:37:24Z

"Ok I'm just very confused...usually I love everything he does, visually, lyrically, musically, but in this visual expression I just really don't vibe with it. But I understand that sometimes art is meant to be disturbing, it's meant to draw a certain reaction from the audience. That's what I feel like Abel was doing here, because it definitely leaves a unpleasant memory for the viewer, something that will stick in their mind, something shocking and unpleasant. The reaction of which is the entire purpose of art, I feel it's purpose will be made clear to each individual later in life, as they watch this video back. Abel is a true artist and he is aiming to make an impact, which he has achieved.",@carlissaneumann8133,2025-02-10T13:57:36Z

"The pregnant woman symbolizes creation, transformation, and the emotional weight The Weeknd carries. She represents his struggle for rebirth or new beginnings, reflecting his inner conflict with fame and the consequences of his past. The surreal and disorienting imagery adds to the idea that while there’s potential for change, it’s unclear whether it’s positive or negative.",@ahmediscoful,2025-02-02T04:55:35Z

"This song and whole album is a masterpiece!! Nicki's bars were genius and all the word play was brilliant!! You can definitely tell she is incredibly intelligent and has a lot of wisdom!! Her flow and technique is flawless!! She spit so effortlessly and fluently!! Her breathe control is perfect and she articulates her lyrics very clearly!! Nicki is so versatile the way she constantly and smoothly switches up her flow is impeccable!! Nicki gave us rap, pop, dance music, afrobeat and R&B all in one album!! love it!! Pink Friday 2 is fire 🔥 and I'm definitely here for it!! I think she did an amazing job!! Nicki righteously deserves the title of ""Queen"" and this album absolutely proves that!!",@EricaMarie72410,2024-02-19T22:30:39Z
I absolutely love this song!! I keep listening to it over and over!! I don't like some of the newer hip-hop that is out nowadays!! To me it's lost a lot of resemblance of what it use to be but this song was great and makes me feel good!! That's also why I love Nicki so much because she has always stayed true to the art!! True hip-hop is about meaningful and intelligent bars!! The ability to tell a story in their music that people can relate too! Nicki brings all the good qualities and traits of old school plus the ability to incorporate new school hip-hop by keeping her beats and lyrics fresh!! Nicki did an amazing job!! This song is definitely a hit!!,@EricaMarie72410,2024-02-19T22:29:58Z

"Repent and believe in the Lord Jesus. Sin feels great, but in the end it leads to death(eternal separation from God in the pit of fire) God loves you so much and wants you to turn to Him. He will change you. The world gives you (temporary happiness)but in the end you are  feeling emptiness and wanting more of something , but it can never fill that hole in your heart and depression. Once you taste Jesus He will be all you ever want in your life and you will have His peace and joy in any situation if you allow Him to be Lord of your life. Life is so short and your never know whens your last day on earth, don't play Russian roulette with your soul. Eternity is forever.. Just call out to Jesus for Him to help you. If you love your sin , just ask Jesus to help you hate it, just be real with Him (but respectful ofcourse) and pour out your heart. Love you all",@kimAb983,2024-01-09T22:42:28Z

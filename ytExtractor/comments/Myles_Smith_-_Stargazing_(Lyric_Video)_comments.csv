"I heard your song on a Nashville Humane Society clip.  I fell in love with it instantly. It was absolutely perfect in showing the pictures of the dogs and getting people to adopt them.  After watching the video I went on a Google search. It led me to YouTube. That song actually made me cry...good tears. Then to put a face with the voice...it was magical! This is my new favorite song and I cannot stop listening to it. Thank you for the music, for the lyrics, and for your talents.  I can't wait to see, hear and learn more about you and your music.  I wish you much luck and love in all you do!  RMB, MISSOURI",@reneab5812,2025-03-08T15:16:24Z

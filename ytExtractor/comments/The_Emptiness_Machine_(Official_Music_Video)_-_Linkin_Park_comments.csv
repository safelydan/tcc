Chester conveyed emotions, he transported you to a world full of feelings, colors, and emotions; he didn‚Äôt just scream. She, on the other hand, screams for the sake of screaming, offering nothing beyond the technical act itself.

I‚Äôm 42 now. For me Linkin park is a band that makes  part of my identity. I was 19 in the early 2000‚Äôs when you guys blew up. It might as well have been a soundtrack for many of my good times and low times in my life. And one of the reasons why the first transformers movie was one of my favorite movies was because of the end. When Prime starts talking at the end looking into the horizon and the piano comes in and is met with the machine sounding drums and BLAST OFF IN THE CREDITS!! I felt amazing!!!! And Chester Bennington passing away was hard for a lot of us. He has kids and so do I. And his lyrics was him crying out and I wish he could have gotten whatever help he needed. But he will always be amazing in my eyes. When I heard this song for the first time with Emily Armstrong and I heard her vocals I was like ‚ÄúOk. Let‚Äôs do this. I‚Äôm excited for this. I‚Äôm down for it. I hope this brings you guys the revival that you deserve. And I‚Äôm sure Chester would be proud. Thanks you guys for this.,@frankyjas5184,2025-01-18T22:24:57Z

"The problem is that the classification of the female voice starts an octave higher than that of a man, a man with a lower voice is a bass, like Sepultara or that guy with the deep voice speaking, a male middle voice is a baritone, Corey Taylor (Slipknot) or David Draiman (Disturbed), a high voice, Andre Matos - Shaman for example, the first female voice is the contralto, which would be the lowest voice among women that is still higher than the tenor, the voice of the lead singer of Linkin Park is higher than that of a tenor Andre Matos for example, but I know that the songs do not explore such high regions, That is. .. Linkin Park have lost weight in their vocals in the bass sense, but they've gained weight in the treble. Appreciate this new vocalist, she's incredible, and she's brought Linkin Park back to life. As a fan who is curious about vocal training and theory, I believe that Mike Shinoba has done a great job.",@chuazinerd3340,2025-01-11T04:47:40Z

So many artists fade with time and when they manage to come back with new material the old fans get excited and nostalgic and support their beloved artists regardless of how good or bad they are just bc it's ""them"", the soundtrack of their favorite teenage years, but deep down they're underwhelming. I've seen it many times. But this is different. This feels and sounds as good as LP did when I was a kid many years ago. I didn't just listened to it out of curiosity bc LP is back, I found myself playing this song in my head, a very rare thing these days.

If u decided to start new part of LP dont promote yourself with LP songs that were written in past , write whole bunch of new songs and do tour and etc. But destroying honor of Chester with oversinging his songs as female is disguisting and for me as for fan that was from day one literally i had first albums bought on cassets , this is not acceptable . You ruined legacy of band , trying to do what you do .everyone have right for new start and ac dc started with new solist and many others but noone change for other sex vocalists because songs are written specific way and require specific vocals to be what they are.

Get steven universe vibes from this song,@Snowyspyder,2024-12-15T05:06:48Z
"Emily's vocals are so damn impressive but idk why people are hatin her , she's literally perfect in her own way but people pulling chester in every damn part is so sad to see , he's gone now we all know that period was impressive but now when he's gone the band members have the courage to start a new beginning let's root for it and make it perfect just like chester would've wanted.....‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üî•",@Theprestigeacts,2024-12-15T04:34:44Z
"I really like her in the new songs, but I wasn't a fan of her on the old ones, EXCEPT for Papercut. I think she channeled it right on that one. Her vocals needed to be a bit more somber with less vocal techniques on the higher notes. Otherwise I'm a fan and can't wait to hear what's next.",@mischievousamoeba,2024-12-14T11:30:14Z
No thanks. You don't replace a male vocalist with a female vocalist and call it the same band.,@astronomicalreason9807,2024-12-14T07:24:44Z

They do this for Chester they continue because Chester's is still pushing them toward from another realm. Is so chilling to listen to the old linkin park and you hear him clearly state in the lyrics he was done... that's why he sang the way he did it was just music it' was all he had left from his constant battles brhind close doors even my self 3x dealt with what he unfortunately didn't make out from so his lyrics for me isn't just words that sound good when he screams them or sings them his lyrics are truths we all want to ignore in this living hell and that truth is there's no way out there is no remedy for the poison that flows through the vains there is no medicine to cure the pain that it brings... just brief moments that vanish quicker than they come constantly reminding you of the sound of deaths drumüò¢,@bennyjames558,2024-12-13T05:41:24Z

"I grew up listening to Linkin Park, and it was amazing with Chester. He made his name in history and in the hearts of many, and he will never be replaced. My first thoughts when I heard that Linkin Park would come back were the same instinctive bad reaction to change. But now, after listening, I realize Emily is not a replacement; she is a new beginning, with a soul that matches the legacy of Linkin Park. The first roar coming from the background in the first chorus of the song gave me chills because I felt like the soul of Chester was there. Welcome, Emily, and welcome back, Linkin Park!",@kretzer52,2024-12-12T14:29:33Z

"Chester Bennington FOREVER He put himself into the songs and always went all out, it wasn't just about his voice.  The newly sung songs are good, but they lack emotion, there is no life in them. It's just about the voice. Good luck in your continued career.",@miskalion,2024-12-11T13:47:30Z
Screw the haters Linkin Park is back. The lyrics and sound are fantastic. Working for the emptiness machine sucks.,@darth-umbrex,2024-12-11T11:29:51Z
"Great voice, I love her energy and how she both sings the melody and sharply marks parts of the rythm with her voice as if it were not just voice, but also part of the percussions, she reminds me of Sandra Nasic of Guano Apes. She really fills the stage.",@albertomonachesi3650,2024-12-11T00:56:44Z

They should have renamed the band when she became the vocalist. Linkin Park will never be the same,@hannabulyar7646,2024-12-10T00:07:33Z
"It took me awhile to get on board with the new singer... at first it was just too hard to hear anyone but Chester do the vocals but after I heard the same song a few times, it started growing on me.... Now I am totally on board.... and will be getting the new album.   Thank you for choosing to continue on....",@jennifercappiwilliams5889,2024-12-09T23:46:09Z

"I want to love it. The arrangement is fire. The message, a regurgitated Numb. I love the chord progression and the intention. However, this lacks depth. I‚Äôm sorry. I still love linkin park. All I really want to say is, dig a little deeper. And, welcome Emily. Welcome. I mean that. No one will ever replace Chester and I accept that.

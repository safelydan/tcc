"Since everyone is expressing their feelings in the comments, why shouldn't I participate? I have a friend whom I love so much, madly, and I think I'm going to lose my mind because of her. She's just an online friend I've known for a while, but our relationship is complicated. I miss her now. We don't talk because of some tension, even though I love her. She pretends to love me, but sometimes her actions prove otherwise. This is the second time we've fought. Well, I'm losing my mind. The first time I tried to get over her, but now I've given up. She won't leave my mind, even though she's just a friend. I love her so much, and I will continue to love her. I see her in my dreams, I think of her even if a thousand friends chase her, and even if I don't know what's going on, she's on my mind. I hope she's okay. I decided to stay away from her for the second time because I felt like an unwanted party. I'm simply going crazy because of her. I don't know how to express myself, or even how to feel. I wish her all the happiness and the best. She doesn't know how much I love her, and how many sad, deep, or happy songs remind me of her.  This is one of those songs that when I hear it, it's the first thing that comes to mind. Thank you, Bilie for this song.",@xivlcnloc,2025-03-20T20:01:15Z

"""I'm 19 years old, and as far as I can remember, I've cried only four times in my life—once when my older brother passed away, once when my grandmother passed away, and once for the person I've been madly in love with for a year. I've never felt a mother's or a father's love. This song was released on my birthday, and it became the fourth thing to make me cry. Because, deep down, it reminds me the person i fell in love.""",@sametyr,2025-03-11T12:42:55Z

I'm going to be honest - I used to not like Billie Eilish as a kid but now that I'm a teenager I understand her music more and it speaks to me in such unexplainable ways.Her music is melancholic and sad - but I like that about her - she expresses all the emotions and feelings through her writing without caring if it's too sad or depressing to some people.And that is true art and true talent in my opinion - the expression of true emotions without fear or judgement.Just being sad and understanding that sadness is sometimes better than happiness.Sadness teaches us so many things happiness can't.And many famous people have gone through so much trauma only to come back stronger.I finally understand Billie and her music and I'm really grateful that her songs are sincere and truthful without faking happiness or optimism - just pure melancholy and grief that is slowly teaching us some lessons.,@zoranmiskic9406,2024-12-25T21:46:51Z

I told him, “she’s into you!” even though I knew he knew that. to make this story short, they started dating, in fact they both agreed a relationship.",@vullvikiww,2024-12-23T09:44:46Z

"The song is psychologically deep. I feel like I'm falling down to the bottom of the ocean when I listen. Along the way down, the fish that are swimming nearby are calling out to me and singing the song. Eilish really has a unique sound to her voice and her whispering quality makes me want to listen further. Or at least, listen more closely than I would for other songs. I read some context about the song, and I suppose there are some fan theories about how she is referring to both an ex-boyfriend and another ex-girlfriend of her ex-boyfriend. It seems to be a song where she is comforting the ex-girlfriend, but then also speaking directly to the ex-boyfriend about her own experiences having dated him. That really is a rich and provocative love triangle, especially how now some people think that she is friends with the ex-girlfriend. I'd give this song over all the very solid rating. I'm just not necessarily a big fan of Eilish's whispering and lulling me to sleep tonality. The song has a really rich meaning that I appreciate.",@Purple_Cat_97,2024-12-19T15:56:05Z

"I've been single for my entire life. I've never met a guy who would even dare shed an eye in my direction, sometimes I wonder if my heart is invisible. To be fair, it's not I've been around much places with any options. I'm okay being single, I try to love myself. I do enough to keep safe, but sometimes when I see couples in the store, or online, or really anywhere I'll feel this sickening lovesick heartbreak that can't be described in a way that would make sense. It makes my heart ache, wondering where my guy walking with me down the sidewalk is, or the soft smile in the darkness. I try not to get jealous, it feels more closer to grief. Each year gets a little harder, the older I get, the worse I tend to feel. The deeper the pain gets. I hope I find him.",@byersxxkarate5177,2024-12-06T23:14:15Z

"I love billie so much and yes shes so hot n all but Holly shit. She's so beyond talented her music touches many hearts and she really is the voice of our generation in my opinion. She's got this enchanting voice that just makes me wanna listen to everything she says it's crazy. I love how honest she is when she speaks and sings. She is kind with her words even when their aggressive it's so weird. I love this song and many of her other ones. She is the moment! She's so relatable and is perfect for any age I'm only 17 and I might not always relate to all her songs but I feel the emotion and the passion. I feel the message she sends to people and it's so impactful, i can only hope she sees this comment and know how loved she is  not by just me but by many others.

"When this song first came out I thought it was absolutely beautiful, but more recently it has become the most relatable song in my life. My situation isn't the same as Billie's, I didn't develop a relationship with a friends ex or lose a friend in any way, I found out me and boyfriends ex have the same name, and I didn't find out from him, his ex told me, I had been sitting in class with her for weeks and I had no idea, I thought it was cute we had the same name because i didn't know anyone else with the same name as me, except her. When I found out I felt betrayed, I felt like an idiot, I felt so incredibly naive, I felt like I didn't know the person I loved more than anything bc I saw him as someone who would never ever hurt me and he did hurt me, a lot by not telling me sooner, and because of this my view of him changed and that was difficult to get over, it still is. This happened almost two months ago. We're still together and he is truly the best boyfriend in the world, I know he is, and it's not really his fault that we have the same name, I just wish we didn't. I always liked my name until that day, that day I wished it could be literally anything else. I know this may sound immature but I hate being in the same class as her. I love my relationship but sometimes I wish I could forget about this whole situation for just a second, bc since it happened I've felt like there's just this grey cloud that's constantly above my head and it never goes away. The lyrics in this song hit me like a ton of bricks whenever I hear it now and although it may not be the same situation it feels like at least Billie can sort of understand how I feel.",@krissy8787,2024-11-03T23:45:48Z

"Hi Billy. I've been listening to you since I was about 16, today I'm 20. My life has always been shit. My father beat my mother, my mother beat me and strangled me since I was 4. At school, everyone humiliated me and wished me death for my appearance. Then at 15 I was raped after my birthday, my friend did it so that I would forget my ex with whom she started dating. She asked her ex to do it. Then when I was 16, 17, everything started to get better, but in 2022 the war started and I had to leave for Germany with my mother and sisters. And I lost everything, my whole life and everything that I built there. In Germany, we had almost no money at the beginning, there were problems with integration, and I pulled everything on myself, I translated all the documents. Then, against the background of my mother beating me, the war, and everything that was happening, I developed Gastritis and Pancreatitis. I have been having relapses for 2 years now and I literally vomit blood and bile. It's better now, but I spent my 18 years on a drip. Here in Germany they don't help me with my problem as I need because I'm an immigrant from Ukraine. Then I found a guy who at first looked at others while I worked for Onlyfans to somehow survive, and supported him and myself when I myself didn't have a penny, and even when I ended up in the hospital again, my father didn't give me a penny, considering that my grandfather was a politician. Then I was baptized, and my father, being a very religious person, completely abandoned me. At all. But then I had another breakdown, and I had to go to him in Ukraine for treatment. In the end, we had a terrible fight about religion, and on my 19th birthday he kicked me out of the house, and I had to go to the city center at night to the 26th floor when the lights went out and the elevator didn't work. my family is divorced, everyone is on their own and everyone is going crazy. but they completely forgot about me. and even writhing in pain I passed the B1 language exam, which here they take for 5-6 years, and my father said (to my mother, not even to me) - well done, let him go to work. fucking awesome. as a result, now my mother and I are being evicted from the house, and we have half a year to find housing. but I have that very guy who eventually fell in love with me and thanks to him alone I am alive now. and thanks to your songs. my family, life is falling apart right before our eyes. my mother suffers from bipolar disorder, my father is completely incomprehensible, I have borderline disorder. and I don’t know what to do next… maybe someday you will notice, here is my instagram - lunarinshine",@lunarinshine,2024-10-04T14:51:29Z

The verse when she says “ I should put it all behind me shouldn’t I? But I still see her in the back of my mind all the time” truly speaks to me. I was physically abused and SA’d in my childhood and I suffered in silence for over a decade. So there’s a lot of pictures of me as a kid fake smiling and the pain behind my smile still haunts me to this day. I can’t even look at certain pictures of myself when I was a kid without bursting into tears. I thought I put my past behind me but sometimes the haunting image of my younger self fake smiling creeps back into my mind 💔,@MermaidElizabeth,2024-06-08T20:45:34Z

Billie was so insecure about her ""friend"" because Billie knew he still loved her.  Not sure what billie expected.",@nidzaboricua3294,2024-06-04T02:00:17Z
"Going back into the chorus, the freaking ""but baby I..."" ; the rhythm, the harmonies, the production work, the reverb. Just complete bliss. Perfection ❤️",@Genociv,2024-06-03T21:24:43Z

"scrivo questo commento per sfogarmi, ho scoperto che il mio ragazzo ha scritto ""mi manchi"" alla sua ex, mi sento un po' come nel testo della canzone, mi ha mentito per tutto questo tempo e se io gli avessi chiesto ""who was better""? cosa avrebbe risposto? perchè scriverle? me lo merito? nei giorni in cui lui scriveva a lei, ero inconsapevole, lo baciavo e gli dicevo ti amo ma lui pensava a lei... non so chi leggerà questo commento, ma volevo solamente scrivere cosa provo",@martacareddu,2024-05-30T02:57:45Z

"I know that Billie conveys her experiences and feelings intensely in all her other songs, but this song was written and sung with a very intense feeling, you can feel it. The song contains a feeling that I have never experienced, but at the same time I feel and it hurts me. There is an experience in the song as if I had lived it and I cry every time I listen to it. Especially the chorus part, it feels very familiar and feels very sincere. The ""Valentine's Day crying in the hotel  "" part leaves a very familiar feeling, as if I had experienced the things described in the song. It may be Billie's most emotional song. She always made emotional songs, but this is a masterpiece, the most emotional song of his so far. Even if you haven't experienced the emotion mentioned in the song, the feeling of having experienced it makes you feel recognized.❤️‍🔥💐",@zeynii,2024-05-20T15:00:16Z

The vocals in the background made me come.,@xyzxyz6449,2024-05-18T11:30:23Z
This is the first time I have listened to this person. A big mistake is to have the lyrics printed as she sings. It just shows how childish and immature they are!  Most eight-year olds can write rhyming poetry!,@rupertthecat875,2024-05-18T09:40:23Z
Okay but this was a masterpiece 😵 Billie is not like the other generic repetitive pop girls ! Her lyrics hold so much more meaning.,@yanesearevalo,2024-05-18T05:00:04Z

Reminds me a lot of the music I listened to in the 90's. Billie reminds me of when Fiona Apple first came out. Both powerful singers/songwriters.,@cheaptshirt,2024-05-17T23:04:32Z

"l like the sound of this, but she had better lyrics even when she was a teenager, this album has lyrics that seem like a 12yo kid would write, maybe it's her choice of words, but its just too simple, still l love her",@shirowolff9147,2024-05-17T18:20:28Z
"this song is so emotional, it awakens every cell in you and makes you literally feel everything she sings about, it's amazingly beautiful",@rrowenne,2024-05-17T18:03:04Z
Do yall think this could be a single? This song is my most favourite track on the album. She is so good with this kind of tone and melody. Soft yet heavy. Like how she did with What Was I Made For which won big awards.,@imantingz,2024-05-17T16:25:06Z

Thank you for posting the new videos with the lyrics! As someone with audio processing difficulties hearing lyrics can be hard and captions make it so much nicer to listen to a song. Sucks to have to wait for an alternate version so it's nice it was included in the original!,@thejuanderful,2024-05-17T09:29:44Z
"wow.... the entire album stella but this is arguably some of her most mature writing, effortless vocal performance...and damn fin's production! favorite on the record along with skinny.",@chikondiseyani9766,2024-05-17T09:10:11Z

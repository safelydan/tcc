I dare you watching this. Read the lyrics. Set your metronome low. The song speed increases in your mind.. Check the frequency. Feel the vibrations. Sing a long.. this is where it gets interesting. Listen to how the words warp lengthen and strecth. I wont spell it out. But I dare you listen to the words you sing. That is the crazy part - good luck 🙏✝️,@christophephilippe1481,2024-08-14T10:40:21Z

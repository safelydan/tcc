"It would not surprise me to find an unusually high ratio of mental illness among this wicked woman's listener base. This is engineered hypnotic repetitive mind-hack ""music"". She has no emotion,  no expression,  no artistic value,  no story to tell. It's just monotone depressing self loathing angry hatred repeated over and over an over. This evil sound creates depression, isolation, despair, hopelessness, fear of close relationships, anxiety,  expectation of betrayal,  anger,  etc. This leads to suicidal thoughts. Your mind is under attack!! SNAP OUT OF IT! You are under a spell.",@edwardriley4923,2025-03-05T20:30:01Z

Many of you aren't old enough to remember the nineties, but she's doing nineties choreography, dances that have already been in many videos. The only real thing people like, if she's half naked, the whole the whole video. Aka music porn. 2 out of 10 .

It's like a Lil porn show, every main stream artist. Female artists use their own body, male artist use female hot girls in the vdo. It's a loud ""SEX SELLS"" it's mind numbing at times. Only Billie eilish, adele n TS have reached as far as they have without going this far, with them.u r more indulged in tye music n lyrics than taken over by aggressive sexual content.

"We finally have this generation's answer to Britney Spears. We thought the sex was turned up with Britney. (and initially- it was HER idea to sex up her image. go awf queen) But with Tate-- its turned up to an 11. She's definitely her own artist, but the Britney references and influences are definitely there. And thats a major compliment. Unique vocal tricks. Sexy, powerful, dance focused, fun pop sound. I mean... the brown and denim outfit is totes  Britney ""Slave 4 U""-coded. The opening outfit before the naked arrest was basically the exact outfit Britney wore for the promo shoot for the 2000 VMAs. Head to toe inspo. Then, we get ""I Wanna Go"" video vibes with the indecent exposure and getting naughty-arrested. I repeat, COMPLIMENT. This is a y2k gay guy's dream. A true ode to tge 2000s and an authentic pop-gasm oozing with tongue-in-cheek sex appeal and fierce fabulousity.",@probablyjoeyy,2024-10-24T11:44:47Z

"There are so many Britney Spears references. From Britney's David LaChapelle Photoshoot in NYC with a Hot Dog in her hand. The hat from Britney's 2002 VMA outfit. Naked and arrested like Britney's ""I wanna go"" Music video where she flashes the cop and gets arrested. Then Britney's diamond bra and nipple coverings from Dream with in a Drean Tour and Rolling Stone photoshoot in 2001. Plus the bandana look from Markus Klinko's photoshoot of Britney for her Onyx Hotel Tour Promo Booklet. So so so so so many copied looks from Britney.",@aries8402,2024-10-11T04:12:47Z

"Though Tate is very talented with good vocals and has a loyal fanbase, it looks like she has come to this realisation about what actually sells in the industry. And unfortunately talent isn't one. I have followed her since I didn't know she could also sing and was only a dancer, and I have always thought she was very talented. But talent is only gonna get you so far.

"Video’s kinda fun, song’s naff - all her other singles have great choruses and this feels a let down. Big build up then no pay off. Then again, not a fan of spoken choruses generally. ‘Greedy’ is a high bar as it’s pretty much a perfect video.",@megkelly1686,2024-09-28T22:24:14Z

"I love her, BUT ONCE AGAIN, she has a song with no potential for global recognition. She needs to work with top-tier producers like RedOne to truly make it on the world stage. Despite being my current favorite, this song feels forgettable and lacks the elements of a global hit. The production quality of the impressive video seems mismatched with the song itself. I hope she collaborates with better writers and producers soon because I’d love to see her perform at the Super Bowl halftime show it could be one of the best ever. Massive fan, but a grammy?

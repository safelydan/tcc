"I didn't see this as a ""single"" on first listen for several factors... But upon listening more and more, I think it's one of the best tracks on the album.  Great lyrics, great chord changes and layered vocals (as a Carpenters fan of background vocals, I'm appreciating these layered vocals and sounds more and more on all TS tracks...wish there were more here...). And this song is awesome performed live in concert. We need a music video me thinks!",@Ordinaryfool,2024-05-22T14:51:52Z

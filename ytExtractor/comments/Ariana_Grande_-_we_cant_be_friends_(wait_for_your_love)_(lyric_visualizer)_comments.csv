"I love this song so much. Listen to it every now and again because it’s heavy. Also feel like it speaks on various levels of relationships, like I could say so many lyrics to my parents instead of an ex boyfriend or something of that sort.",@belenandrade5293,2025-01-18T17:50:51Z

"I initially thought this was about a romantic relationship. Looking into the lyrics, I think this is about the relationship between Ariana & media/press/fans (possibly surrounding the rumours she wrecked a marriage). 'You cling to your paper & pens' = waiting to write an article. 'Wait until you like me again' = when the angle changes and she is revered again by the press.  'Me & my truth we sit in silence' = Not addressing the rumours. 'Know that you made me' = the press and fans made her the success she is. 'I'm not how you paint me' = how she is depicted in the media.",@ColinnOk,2024-10-21T22:20:48Z

I love Ari so much. Honestly. I have so much respect for her and as an artist she is phenomenal. This song is truly one of the best ever. The melody and Ari’s beautiful angelic voice. She never misses and her music isn’t overly emotional it still has a poppy tone but a chill vibe. I love her. This song makes me emotional but I love it. 🤍,@lifewithyana2924,2024-09-03T23:11:58Z

we can't be friends (wait for your love) is a song that perfectly describes the ins and outs of falling deeply in love with someone. You hold onto false hopes thinking you could still have a chance with them romantically. Ariana has officially top-billed this song. The vocals are gorgeous throughout the track.,@thisissophiaisabelle,2024-03-08T05:17:32Z

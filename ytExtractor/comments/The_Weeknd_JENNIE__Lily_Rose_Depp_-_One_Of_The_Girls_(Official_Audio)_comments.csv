This guys used to be one of my favs. Such a soothing voice and sick beats. Somehow I got his songs and dirty lyrics when he was in his teenage and twenties. For him to keep going in his thirties with idealising abuse and calling it art is creepy af. Sorry ...not a fan anymore.. Bye.,@user-vf4ct5fy7h,2023-10-21T13:44:00Z
"The lyrics express the singer's desire for a relaxed, no-strings-attached encounter. They're not in pursuit of a lasting relationship or aiming to be someone's special partner. Instead, they simply want to share time with the person as a companion without any romantic commitments. It's a straightforward message about seeking a temporary connection without getting emotionally entangled.",@jstnflyd,2023-10-18T07:28:12Z

Thank God Kendrick saved hiphop. I say that as someone who has witnessed an entire generation thinking ghostwriters for rap is acceptable. NO! Hiphop is the most important genre in terms of your shit being yours. Comedians shouldn’t have ghostwriters nor should rappers. Drakes songs may be catchy or have good rhymes BUT HE DIDN’T WRITE THEM. Hiphop started as a language and it’s a desecration to the entire art form to have ghostwriters. Yet still I see people say they’re nbd. YES THEY ARE AND IT’S WHY DRAKE IS WHACK,@TonyDanza4Lyfe,2025-03-15T17:14:53Z

There was no rap on radio, no rap on tv yet, no internet & social media - you had to physically beat the pavement to either experience hiphop or become a part of its history...

When i found this guy on Tik tok i dead ass laughed over the way he uses his hands when he rapping. Then i was like dam he kinda old to be rapping. Every song got a verse about some gun with a full clip or emptied the clip etc etc. mf got no idea what he talking about it’s not a clip. It’s called a mag or magazine. Anyways regardless of all that. Jamwayne has grown on me hard af. His shit be hard af and he talks about the way normal folks leave. Not about some imaginary gang members or Partnof some million dollar label and shit. I feel like if he was to hit it big big he wouldnt change up on who he was or where he came from he got the same mentality as our boy jelly role,@JustinSmith-h3w,2025-03-02T18:20:35Z

"GUYS GUYS GUYS, I JUST REALIZED SOMETHING! If you look at the lyrics at 1:29 he says “And PARTY at the party, playin' with his nose now” I think he might had knew drake was planning to drop something with PARTYNEXTDOOR because in the lyrics, it says that PARTY at the party. “PARTY” in all caps, might be a reference to PARTYNEXTDOOR saying that he knows they are doing something and he put PARTY in all caps. Considering that they JUST dropped a new album together, $$$4U, Kendrick knew Drake was doing something else behind the scenes (Sorry if that didn’t make sense, and that’s just a theory I made up at midnight, lol)",@Flamed-k4f,2025-03-02T07:28:02Z

"I know the owl is a symbol used by Drake but theres deep spiritual significance as well. The Hebrew word for owl is Lillith, who is a demonic spirit associated with sexual lust. Which is related to Aphroditie from Greece and Ashteroth from Cannanite witchcraft. Also, the statue at Bohemian Grove is an owl but named Moloch who was originally called Molech a god worshipped by the Ammonites and was depicted at a bull. They would make the statue out of iron and a fire would be built in the bottom and they would throw their children alive in the fire because that's what Molech demanded. The combination of Moloch with the symbol of an owl at Bohemian grove is very telling because sexual immorality leads to unwanted children which would be more willingly offered as sacrifice to molech.",@OrderOfMelchizedek777,2025-02-27T16:58:29Z

That scene with Lamar sitting on the bed in cell block 1 is based off a picture taken in 1997 of Mila Jovavich when she was 11. Something to do with the man who discovered her by the name at 11 John luc Brunel. The man was accused of some kind of sexual scandal involving Jefferey Epstein. I don't know specific details but look it up. It completely blew my mind because the rabbit hole is very very deep in the entire video.,@crazygrlfrndman,2025-02-27T13:50:19Z

"You know what’s so crazy about that beat about this whole beef wrapped thing they had going on until Drake, dear family matters and everything I got personal it probably would’ve just been a regular battle. It would’ve got so personal and got this far. Drake knows how to push buttons he’s been doing it for a long time. This even goes back to win. He started to beep with Chris Brown. You know I’m saying so this right here he might’ve bit off a little more than he can shoot yes we give Drake the you know his flowers for being one of the rap arts that stepped to Kendrick cause after Kendrick made that one track and he was coming at everybody. He was the one person that came up and said something when everybody was quiet, but you know what I’m saying it’s crazy how you can poke somebody so bad they just bring it on you and you end up regretting that he’s definitely regretting that even though the way he spazzing out now I haven’t even heard the new PARTYNEXTDOOR album yet, but they say his number is definitely dropped. That’s what happens. He’s dealing with other artists deal with.",@DMarrionWolfe,2025-02-25T02:30:12Z

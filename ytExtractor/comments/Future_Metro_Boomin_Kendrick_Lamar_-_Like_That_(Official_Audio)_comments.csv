"Future verse goes harder(😂) than Kendrick's. Kendrick's verse is hard,but (pause😂) Kendrick's verse is beef.(pause) Future just went in with metro on tha beat.(Pause)🎉",@killafranchise9277,2025-03-21T05:57:52Z
"""Today marks the 1st anniversary of one of the biggest rap beefs in history—Kendrick vs. Drake. It all started with Kendrick’s explosive verse on 'Like That,' sending shockwaves through the industry and igniting a battle that had fans and artists picking sides. What followed was a series of diss tracks, subliminals, and direct shots that kept the culture on edge. Then came 'Not Like Us'—the final nail in the coffin that became an anthem, a victory lap, and a West Coast celebration all in one. A year later, the impact of this feud still lingers. The debates haven’t stopped, the records still hit hard, and the culture was forever changed. So, looking back—who really won?""",@kellykjellburg6818,2025-03-20T23:28:30Z

"Lord knows how this got to be ""Song of the Year"" at The Brit Awards. I can't anticipate anybody singing it two or three years from now. Shouldn't endurance still be a test of a song's quality?

It'll be wrong.  I'm not throwing Diplo's underwear on there.  He has to throw it himself.  Oh, and Johnny Blue Skies.  I'm KEEPING Dove Cameron's underwear for myself and who would want what's his name's underwear?  Umm.  I say ""Use Me (Brutal Hearts).""  I know.  Wrong.  But it was a good guess.  AGAIN?  Fine.  Try...I found this one yesterday.  ""Driver's License"" By Olivia Rodrigo & ""Disease"" By Lady Gaga.  Last week, I think, there's ""Make You Mine"" By Madison Beer & ""STUPID feat. Yung Baby Tate"" By Ashnikko.  AS best I CAn teLl, ""15 Minutes"" By Madison Beer is also rolling with ""Pressure"" By Billy Joel.  It's a start.  My preamble is a wreck. I'm improving.  Oh, I had Serrano's with the moms today.  She got the kidney stones last week and I didn't hear about it until after the fact but she needed some help today and I'm off today so helped set up the new wifi and put things in the vehicle.  The grams died back in December so she's going back and forth dealing with stuff.  Yeah.  Woke up and...noticed Guess.  I don't know.  Day off.

"As a longtime fan (since 2014) I was extremely excited seeing Charli finally getting her flowers after decade+ of hard (and exceptional) work... the very day this song came out on the deluxe I was sending it to my friends, all elated that we got such a gem as an additional gift to already flawless body of music. I liked all of the remixes and was overall fascinated about how good of a rollout this era had. Unfortunately, this particular remix along with all of the excessive draining the brat trends in social made me stop listening to the album completely. Unnecessary, distasteful lesbian references from Billie along with her exceedingly forced what-is-supposed-to-be-sexy tone made the song unlistenable to me. It is such a shame that promotion of explicit, unnatural behavior in song widely used for shorts/tik tok dances mainly consumed by young teenagers is met with reception totally devoid of any criticism. To be clear - I very much like both of the ladies' music and I have no problem with people's sexual preferences, I just stand in opposition to widespread promotion of these ideas to kids. Also, sometimes less is more and this is the proof.",@lsd_connoisseur,2024-09-01T12:21:38Z

"Wow have not heard Charlie Xcx's voice in a decade. Only know her from her hook in Iggy Azalea's ""Fancy"". She looks like a completely different person in this video. Would have never guessed that was the same girl in the hook from Iggy's Fancy video .Never bothered to listen to any of her music throughout all these years. Hell, I've heard Bart Baker's parody of Fancy with a dude impersonating Charlie in the hook more than I heard Charlie sing the actual hook lol So it's fitting how Fancy made me discover Iggy Azalea, Charlie Xcx, and Bart Baker all at the same time. Learned of this track by seeing a pretty female dancing in a video short, and she was dancing to this song. Than I just kept seeing girl after girl dancing to this song in video shorts without me even having to manually search for them. The interesting part of it is that they are all dancing to Billie Eilish's verse, and cut it off where you never hear Charlie whatsoever. I'm guessing Billie Eilish is far more popular than Charlie. This actually is the first time I heard Billie Eilish in a song. Been living under a rock I suppose. I just don't listen to music nearly as much as I did in the past. I really dig this song though. I could so picture this song playing in a cinematic scene of people doing ecstasy, and being extremely sexual with each other. It's a very sexualized type of song, but I'm so digging the vibe of it all. The vibe makes me think of Demi Lovato's 'Cool For The Summer'. I so loved that song when it came out. For some reason I get the vibe that this is the type of song Billie Eilish doesn't typically make. This song keeps sticking in my head along with Billie Eilish's provactive facial expressions. They both look like their under the influence of some drug that enhances sexual libido. The song subject manner makes it seem like their both on ecstasy, and so sexually open for any type of sexual stimulation. I don't know, that's just how I perceived this song and music video. Nonetheless, it's hot and sexy, and seems so hypnotic and addictive. I highly doubt many even blink an eye to the 11 age difference between Charlie and Billie. Charlie is 32 and Billie is 21. As long as one is of legal age, age becomes more and more of a non-factor when it comes to being prejudice towards a big age difference. A romantic/sexual relationship between a 33 year old and a 44 year old would not be very controversial at all. If this came out when Charlie was 21 and Billie was 10, it would disgusting, revolting, and have Charlie imprisoned if she had even the slightest sexual relationship with a 10 year old Charlie Xcx. Age is so controversial when one is underaged with one who is at least 18.",@JaizMusic,2024-08-29T09:31:40Z

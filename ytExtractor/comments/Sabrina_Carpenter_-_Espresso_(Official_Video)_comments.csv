"Hmmmm… nah. Really trynna to give this the benefit but there’s nothing too great about this- feels like a disposable song. Something to me playing in the background eventually in supermarkets I guess but it’s not of substance grand enough to last. It’s my opinion but this entire production, there’s just nothing too special on here. The girls’s voice is pleasant to my senses I don’t mind it. It’s almost like background music. It’s nothing impressive. The vocalist is  no Mariah Carey or Adele or Ariana Grande or Whitney Houston. No she doesn’t belong in that category, but there’s a place for her product, mainly this song here. Like I said it does induce feelings of relaxation. I didn’t pay too much attention to the lyrics, but it didn’t sound  risqué or shocking. just mellow .",@Pitbulloves,2025-03-11T06:37:03Z

"This is the first time I've heard this song. Yes I know it's huge and won loads of awards, but I don't really listen to stuff just because it's popular. Figured I'd listen to it today to see what all the fuss was about and it's okay I guess. But I'm old enough to see/hear all the 80's references in the vibes. Lots of Wham! and even some Duran Duran hints in there. Cute as a summer song I guess, but not something I'm likely to return to.",@BlueHydrangea-v1d,2025-03-03T18:12:51Z

"Congratulations, Sabrina Carpenter for best pop vocal album. You have the most angellic voice out there and are very talented in hitting those high notes. The humor you put into your lyrics makes the song more fun and entertaining to listen to and to watch your performances. Espresso, Please Please Please, Taste, and Bed Chem are all hits from Short N Sweet and in my opinion it's the best album of 2024. Well Deserved and again congrats.",@XSETDangerous,2025-02-03T03:55:33Z

"The song has character, it does what pop music does and it's okay. But it's not special, the message has no value in actual personal development, but if people think it helps it may help them for a while. She just tells girls exactly what they need to hear, even if it'll never be fulfilling. It's not my problem anyway, it's a fun song, good tune, good vibe and rhythm, lyrics are intrinsic bullshit but very creative and full of character. Gives a dreamy summer feeling. I hate the music video not just for all the beauty standards in men and women, there is just so much more. But I don't want to take your joy. Enjoy the song if you like it. Just saying that not every music enjoyer feels the same way and thinks this is perfect. But it certainly is art and for art you have to look very long to find IT. And it's very subjective what mirrors your soul and let's your mind in. If you found yourself here I am happy for you, for me this is just the mainstream. I don't want to be special, I am just different and very deep in my mind, trying to understand and feel everything, which get's me off the stream. Where I find the cold truth, some fragments of it hidden from society or beliefs and I can add this to my perfect working image of the world and life. Perfectly fulfilled in a world where everybody isn't and I can't help no one, because they won't listen and have to find a way that works for them themselves. I could have a philosophic crash out right now, but my thoughts are already taking more space than the absolute attention and understanding I could get or deserve.",@dj_performance,2025-01-30T09:21:12Z

"It seems like a joke when she says: He only thinks about me! But then she says it in the lyrics, I think! She thinks but doesn't say that she is sure and for those who think the lyrics are perfect and some, to deceive themselves, say that it conveys security, although nowadays there is a lot of betrayal because they don't have the gift of fidelity, and also her voice It's not so real, it has controlled mixing effects and high pitches in her voice, I'm not saying she sings badly, but that voice isn't entirely hers, it has superficial effects, maybe live it shows more reality. Therefore, for a flatterer of artists, there is no need to deceive himself, just because he flatters a favorite artist. To make matters worse, some clueless person might even say that I'm jealous, even though I only told the truth, they can be mistaken for me 😅 😏",@marcossmello646,2025-01-03T19:53:05Z

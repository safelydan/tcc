"This song is one of the greatest and my favorite song of the 2020's, because of its revival of 80's synth pop combined with some pop rock elements. I'm a synthesizer and 80's guy myself, and I've heard multiple synth pop bands, and I can hear striking similarities to Tears for Fears and a-ha, both being pop rock and synth pop bands. I can compare this song with ""Everybody Wants To Rule The World"" because they sound a little similar. I feel like End of Beginning is so well-composed, well-structured, and well-written in every way, that I just want to listen to it as many as I want, because it just sounds *_too good._* Everyone has their own interpretations of this song, either a final sendoff to 2024 (primarily because of the lyric, ""Remember '24?""), or a nostalgic feeling. For me, I would go something like one of the usuals, a nostalgic feeling, like looking back to your childhood years.",@tto0508,2025-01-25T14:16:14Z

"This song is a bit like ""Africa"" by Toto, ""Don't Stop Believin'"" by Journey, and ""Carry On My Wayward Son"" all rolled into one, but this one may be my favorite of all of those great songs. This just...hits different. And boy, does it hit hard. It makes me inexplicably sad, and it also makes me want to jam. It makes me nostalgic for a place I didn't grow up in and long for something I'm not sure I ever had. And my God, those harmonies melt me like butter on a hot summer day. Those harmonies are out of thus world, they're so good. And EVERTHING in the song--the lyrics, the synth, and the drums, just to name a few--compliment them so f*cking well. Listening to this almost makes me want to cry.",@tenpiano1920,2025-01-23T20:46:32Z

"Man, this song has never fit so well into the context of my life as it does now, I played and finished Watch Dogs, the first one, which is obviously in Chicago, I remember that when I played it for the first time it was in 2014 when the game was released and now 10 years later, I find myself playing it again and realizing that maybe I judged it a little too much or it's just nostalgia kicking in, I was young at the time so when the part of said song comes ""And when I'm back in Chicago, I feel it"" It's incredible and then comes the emotional bomb of remembering that I'm getting old, ""Another version of me, I was in it"" this part represents very well how our tastes change and what I thought was shit in my youth I see with nostalgia really I still think it's bad, especially the part of the game having the same small freezing problems at high speed, but I can say ""I wave goodbye to the end of beginning""",@TownerHijet,2024-04-13T08:52:13Z

I'm the client when paying for services and directing how I'm wanting things completed not the friend of those that are to be providing the services because since 2019 to currently and it still being done incorrectly it's unprofessional, some of you are too conservative and unprofessional and lack the creativity my team and company requires and you are negligent for deals decided instead and submitted, lost wages, lost opportunities, lost revenue and lost payments for my employees and contractors that can do their job position(s) correctly not one account is a mess up account or an account that should anything other than as directed by the client, period. For the scouts and scoutmasters and those that like reporting on Facebook, as a paying client for what I'm requesting where you all have thousands on your team in agreement one would be best since the year 2020 similar to the layoffs at companies where roles become obsolete, I would have approves thousands and tens of thousands of layoffs, forced resignations, terminations and replacements and a class action lawsuit against those that couldn't present what the client whom is myself requested where I'm paying for services and am not forcing you all to be there where not an employee where you can't take other job positions and assignments at other companies do to my restrictions...",@AJKentInc,2025-02-15T23:22:21Z

"Hello beautiful Ms. Stallion, I'm now coming to terms with something you and I now share in common thanks to the BLM. You made the innuendo about Channing Tatum in your Lyrica and it upset them like he'll to hear a woman of your intelligence and completion that is beautiful to me. I don't like bleached skin no way. And vitiligo is beautiful actually. Abstract of the skin. Anyway it's like this you said his name and the male minds got offended that they put little blockages over your copyright to keep your sales less than deserved, took measures to disclose information about you that isn't true for having a taste for variety. And in that cause they denied you an award for great musical content. So if I had to choose whose side I'd be on I'd look into them more closely BLMM as they don't want us mixing flavors and feel we should hit reverse to pre civil rights boycott status. Idk if you like separate but equal but they plan to push for a separate constitution that will segregate you from the overall industry demographics. So please consider this not as a leak but as part of your pride in your work. Your assets are being leveled down each time you mention any sexual nature that offends them. 8/ P.S if I were race baiting trust me you'd know. I only befriend myself anyways.

Except I lost even though I went to court covered in bruises with me being 5'1"", and him being 6'4"" and 100lbs heavier than me. Women I know that have been through it always lost as well. After a friend of mines bf beat her up, the cop told her the best thing for her to do was move back to Canada because it's legal to beat your gf/wife in Kentucky. It is illegal and the cops handle it the best they can, but when you go before the judge it doesn't matter if you're beat up, have broken bones, just came out of the hospital, etc. The man ALWAYS win here. Another friend of mine got stabbed 7 times by her ex-husband and had to have emergency surgery. She also lost her case. My state was #1 for most domestic violence than anywhere else in the country for a long time. We are #2 now, so we're slowing improving.

This is only a hint of the damage Megan can do. And all with almost no effort or ""fake accents"". Just 1 (devastating) flow 😵🥶🫣 Megan DETHRONED you Nicki. Easily and unbothered.

this chick got a huge platform and i love hiphop and neva knew wshe was so wen i looked her up all her lyrics say something bout her ass or her vagina or a man..how u so rich anybody can rapbout sex..hiphop has been defamed due to greedy ceos and producers signing and making strippers with no real talent hott and so what fell off THE HIPHOP...I am a 80s baby and I love hiphop but I hate it since skinny jeans took over and thots..caus they ass fat...WELL LET THE ASS RAP..,@DW-bl1lv,2024-02-22T04:48:50Z
"I don't understand very well the english language but, put apart the Nicki's drama (in her mind), this song has potential, is powerful. I like the beat, the Megan's voice rapping. Is not only a diss track, is a good rap song. I think this is the reason of the  success. Meanwhile, the Nicki diss track is a little boring (and I love Nicki but her song isn't interesting, I just saying).",@Marco11Marco11,2024-02-21T22:37:15Z

"Less views than FACTS, less comments than FACTS. Yet you're at number 1. You don't deserve this. Life can't be fair anymore. Also actually hearing the beginning ALONE is has MORE CONTARVERSIAL LYRICS than every single lyric in FACTS. Or so in my biased opinion.",@TheL0LL1ThatKeptHisSoul,2024-02-03T18:21:06Z
OMGGGGGGGG !!!!!! SHE RODE THIS BEAT ONGGGG,@Miasoreal,2024-02-03T18:17:43Z
"This blows that so called trash somg ""bigfoot "" out the water..whole vibe and im not a big rap fan..but she spits and spits..excellent song here",@tomistalnaker8521,2024-02-03T17:50:14Z
I just came to see the song Ben Shapiros “FACTS” beat 😂,@user-de2zo1bw4d,2024-02-03T17:00:39Z
Posting another comment cause I can’t stop listening to this. NDA was my fav song of Megan until Hiss. Oooofff it is POWERFUL,@Gine669,2024-02-03T15:37:32Z
"this gives me the same vibes as ""hit em up"" by pac.....I LOVE ME SOME MEGHAANN GUYS?????WOW",@luliboelihlendibongo1036,2024-02-03T14:09:01Z
where lyrics at broooo,@dajanajavorac2974,2024-02-03T12:04:27Z
Teflon Don in the courtroom was absolutely one of the best verses. Fire Meg. Pure fire 🔥,@vonnikki,2024-02-03T11:57:20Z
"Can we talk about the video for a minute tho? What stood out to me was the fact that no scene was rehashed, just like she never repeats any lyrics in the song. Really gives the video and the song this forward momentum that keeps building until she litterally hits a dead end 😍 what else did you guys notice/appreciate?",@sjengplantaz583,2024-02-03T11:28:36Z
"Damn you Ben-zero(benzino), take notes... better yet. let a stallion  (black beauty at that).. show you how to.. take care of business. Gracefully, beautifully and with the interlectual mindset and persevereance.",@keithdelgado9336,2024-02-03T09:39:35Z
Shorty rapping on the same beat she always rapping on ya sleep and that’s okay. Real rap not for everybody 🤷🏼‍♀️ anyone can have a ghost writer… which it’s giving. This the same beat as Captain Hook as every other Megan the stallion song… pls prove me wrong the fuck…,@xEpiccFaillx,2024-02-03T07:22:20Z
Well that was annoying,@seansezz,2024-02-03T05:45:11Z
Was an occasional listener to megan just from her features but this song solidifed her in my mind. I love that there is no chorus or hook. She let someone trash her for x amount of time and it took 1 line to send nicki into a full ass spiral. Hot girl shit.,@chezneys,2024-02-03T05:24:08Z
It’s no SHADE!!! She really ate this FKN Song! And she seams to be on beat to me!,@johnteprice6484,2024-02-03T05:11:41Z
"""I feel like Mariah Carey, got ONIKA so obsessed..."" should be the lyrics 🤣",@cdnry0020,2024-02-03T04:41:10Z
Brabz don’t have bars to match this fire. She should’ve hush now she gotta face the hiss. I know she’s piss re-thinking what she thought was her best move is actually her worst move.,@ryanhenry2096,2024-02-03T03:13:15Z
JT slid and this beat slide!!! 🔥🔥🔥 🎶 👌🏾💯,@blacktribetv1755,2024-02-03T02:40:07Z
"Sigh, just another lame song with a good beat",@andrewdowell2663,2024-02-03T02:29:39Z
"Such an odd sense of self-worth. A masculine, quarrelsome, annoyingly indecent woman. Good luck with selling yourself, I suppose. Hopefully she doesn't lead to many young women down the wrong path with these Lyrics she's constantly rehashing. Before all the hate comes. It's not for you. It's for the people reading this. That arent replying. It's for those who are confused about the right path. God bless all of you. Even the angry folks. Edit- I've had a couple replies so far. Ironically, a blind man could see the lackluster, stale, and same old regurgitated simple hit and run insults. Hopefully, this comment reaches who needs it.",@fosterblue4457,2024-02-03T02:07:26Z
imagine how nostalgic this'll be in 10 years or so,@inari198,2024-02-03T01:28:46Z
Megan and a good beat is a dangerous duo ☝️❤️😩,@shanequatoles7410,2024-02-03T00:59:48Z
Only for those know how to write lyrics. Cardi and Latto OUT!!!,@areyoulost_hidy,2024-02-03T00:09:07Z
"So Megan's law is a mandate that concerns the reporting of sex offenders, woah. How desperate for a punch line you have to be to reference such abusive behavior. No one has ever done it on such a larger scale then Ms.Minaj, these females that participate in this rap game do not put there heart into any of there compositions. How good your vagina is, eel that is not sexy, what's sexy is ""high heels on my tippys, Dolce & Gabbana on my..."" that's beautifully elegant. Be you who ever it is you are, don't push music that does not coincide with your character. 🤢",@derrellgray3857,2024-02-02T23:42:13Z
"this is the 164681341894651864th time ive seen this, and it still goes hard every time! i just get chills when she raps bc its just so hard! i feel like she my mom and im ab to get my ass beat! like yessss pop tf off sissss!!!",@Its_EvieJ,2024-02-02T22:01:45Z

"Now this is real talent! Megan never needs cheap shots to make true music, Nicki should take notes 🐍",@AlexGarcia-hj2ii,2024-02-02T19:12:14Z
"How is nikki still breathing? Megan k!ll3d this. Nikki couldn't even rap the end she had to whisper 😅.  Everything was on point the lyrics, visuals, vocals 🔥🔥",@crazydaisy02,2024-02-02T18:39:28Z
This whole song is a beat and straight bars for 3 minutes straight. And she came for everyone and mentioned 0 names or likeness. If the offense match then it’s you 😂😂😂😂😂,@ChrissyAnn85,2024-02-02T18:13:47Z
"I don’t even like Megan’s music. But god damn. Nicki got fucking bodied with one line. The beat, the flows, everything on point with this. Nicki’s shit sounded like she rolled over in bed and recorded it on her phone at 2 AM.",@alcabron1789,2024-02-02T17:34:01Z
Wack. Rap on a hip hop beat .,@dynomitegaming,2024-02-02T15:41:28Z

"LoL, OUT. I had to see what the fuss was, heard F word S word N word before the beat even dropped. What a slapper. I dont mean to Offend You",@swills4772,2024-02-02T09:45:35Z
That might quite possibly be the worst piece of music I've heard in my entire life.,@FKA_Skull,2024-02-02T07:03:53Z

As a straight dude who just listened to this for the first time this week. I like the vibe and like the message. I see it and dig it. But I also see that it could be interpreted 2 ways. The way of a girl coming out as a lesbian. And the way of someone regardless of gender or orientation realizing that they love someone after so long and finally admitting it. Either way it‚Äôs a very good song.,@jacksonthomas1851,2025-03-02T04:27:02Z

I usually don't care for modern music. I know it sounds pretencious and all that yeah yeah. But I fucking love Chapelle Roan and her music. Girl knows how to sing and the mix of modern musical tropes and the eighties synth vibes to almost all her songs absolutely fucks. Also helps that she is a goddamn gay icon at this point and I hope she continues her rise. Good shit good shit.,@astaroththedaeva9717,2025-02-25T04:48:51Z
"Chappell, I had a beautiful time with your song, 'good luck babe'. As I showered I though: how can anyone leave a woman with just that hit alone and that heartfelt melody of vocals. Than I saw you were gay and I cried with you. Feeling your pain. Although I can't relate to the gay part, it made me think how united we all are and can share your pain. With that song along you've touched so many people. I thank God for your disappointments in all your relationships. Because you've helped others through your experience. I want you to know that my vibes and blessings are being send your way. I send you love and appreciation and we are all one with God! May God bless your way ‚ù§ you are not alone girl!

People of my age and a little older love the beach cuz it literally reminds you of that time and those places I mean it's really good it's a really good song, but that's the big appeal in synthwave has been going hard for a long time now and this is like one of the first mainstream songs that's been pushed into the bigger audience.

"It's a good song, but looking at the lyrics as a story, it's possible the lover really is a closeted lesbian. But it's more likely that, the character Chappell is portraying is lacking self-awareness. The _contempt_ with which she says 'nothing but a wife' shows how she doesn't respect heterosexual relationships and that they can be loving too. So I think she's using her own lack of understanding/empathy towards straight couples to turn this into an 'us vs them' thing. Maybe her ex left her simply because of Chappell's personality, and she doesn't want to face that. So she blames straightness instead. 'You didn't leave me because I'm shallow; it's because you're in denial.' Seems implausible.",@AlexReynard,2025-02-11T21:38:57Z

You dont have to stop the  world to stop a feeling .  U gonna let an emotion get you life that gurl ?  I was in LOVE / LUST with somebody that was so so so  bad for me .  But my feelings told me otherwise. 1.5 yrs later i got out of it.  Never trust a feeling or a fart for that matter  !!,@mikevinny9715,2025-01-06T23:24:52Z

Lovely catchy song.  She is a moaner and I don't think she will last long.  Seems to be struggling heads all over the place.  I hope she does well. Sacked her manager attacks everyone.  Struggling with fame.  Seems confused.  She split from her boyfriend in 2020 and now is a lesbian.  Being gay should help her get some attention.  Good luck babe.,@jimipurple123,2024-10-31T11:15:45Z

I'm getting Kate Bush vibes. Huge compliment,@jaycee2687,2024-10-23T13:03:08Z
I first saw Chappell at Coachella. I didn't know what the fuck I was watching and didn't take it seriously but this was her breakout moment. Im crying right now as I'm writing. I vibed a little bit at the show but other than Sabrina Carpenter who was also performing has any other artist touched me so emotionally and made me want  to follow the to hell and back through their expressions of life as they've lived it. its raw and really just a genre of its own. Taylor Swift hit a few of the notes for me but she is just overpopulated ( not hating... I love her) Chappell roan is an elevated version of Taylor with brilliant vocals,@ryankrauss5622,2024-10-22T15:18:37Z

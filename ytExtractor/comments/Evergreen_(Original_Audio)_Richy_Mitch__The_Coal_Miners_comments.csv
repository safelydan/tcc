"How a song can make you feel like you're a wave crashing on a shoreline, new life, and a bird soaring above, while simultaneously making you feel like a leaf fighting the wind in a beautiful but deadly dance, or a wolf sorrowfully howling is beyond me. It brings back a hurricane of memories, emotions, regrets and gratitude all at once.",@marinairathemagnificent,2023-03-22T08:37:09Z
This song is just a different vibe which I can't explain ‚ù§,@samuelmathew3179,2023-03-20T14:48:05Z
"The first full strum of this song and those high notes immediately reset my whole soul and body like I‚Äôm taking a deep breath of crisp air. Even as I‚Äôm stuck at home in my room I feel as if I‚Äôm on an adventure, feeling the earth beneath my feet and hearing nothing but the birds‚Äô songs overlapping one another. Finally found a new song to learn on my guitar haha. Thank you for creating this magical masterpiece and providing fuel for my never ending fantasies I dream out in my mind ‚ù§",@niffspade,2023-03-09T08:31:11Z
"Music is a powerful thing. It's like a river that connects two points, those points being you and other people. It connects us to each other. It can either drag you down to earth and bring your head out of the clouds or it can make you feel like you're floating above the clouds. Music isn't just supposed to make you happy. It's supposed to make you feel. People can interpret songs in different ways or connect them to their life how they want. Most songs people listen to, they listen to because they're relatable. And music that makes you feel more than one thing at once is truly amazing. Nothing keeps me more grounded than music does. And I can't stress enough how much music means to me. I can't live a day without it.",@ilov3kurtcobain,2023-03-03T17:45:42Z
"I don't know what it is about this song, but something about it just makes u want to cry. Sometimes they're happy tears and sometimes they're sad tears. But a song being able to make u feel both happy and sad at the same time just proves how amazing and powerful it is. And the way you can interpret this song in anyway you want is truly amazing. It's amazing how well the beat and music of the song just makes me want to just drift away like a feather in the wind and sometimes makes me want to just lay in the grass and watch the skies from day to night over and over again until my eyes burn out of their sockets or time just passes by that there is no sky anymore. Truly an amazing song.",@ilov3kurtcobain,2023-03-03T14:38:59Z

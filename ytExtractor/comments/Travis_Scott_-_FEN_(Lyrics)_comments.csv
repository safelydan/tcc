"Other than the chorus, which is pretty basic in itself, the rest of this song is pretty trash. No flow, no actual bars, nothing content. No talent really, sick beat, say the same word again and again, and use auto tune/pitch up the voice and call it a wrap.",@imrankhoja3870,2025-02-22T02:12:37Z

This is a weird ahh story I’m bouta tell… so one random Friday at my school we had this thing called “dress in neon day” and some ppl dressed in neon in our class mostly none but after school we went in the gymnasium and got glow sticks? I was so confused then I saw the light were off and EVERYONE had glow sticks and neon clothing and we had a WHOLE RAVE music blasting in my ears(mostly Christian bcuz I’m in a Christian school) but by suprise.. they actually started playing this..LIKE WHAT. FEIN IN A CHRISTIAN SCHOOL?!?!?! idk what was going on but I was hyped asf all the boys in the class were just yelling the girls didn’t know what was going on but me and my friend just vibed that was probably the best Friday of my life.,@stxriscool,2024-09-21T18:46:54Z

"I saw him this week at SXSW, and I have a lot more respect for him. The screechy tone in Beautiful Things grates on me, but he can really sing and is an energetic showman.

"Your song writing and your music which reflect your authentic self, your broad vocal range and amazing voice in general (it gives me goose bumps), being so accomplished at playing multiple instruments..... You are pure talent and passion and still so young, you're incredible. In my opinion the best new artist and music I've heard in many years. I've watched interviews you gave and you you were asked about your moustache in one of them. You don't need it to look older or prove anything (you actually look better without it, but that's just my take). You are a star and you will continue to rise higher and shine brighter. So what if you have a ""baby face""? You'll be glad of it when you're older and look younger üôÇSame goes for your stage costumes, jewellery and red carpet outfits. When compared to your earlier videos and appearances, which you look absolutely great in, it seems that more recently you adopted a persona. It's fine if that's your personal style but it's jars with your authenticity, your fun, down to earth, genuine attitude and your beautiful music. If you have stylists or managers or whoever, advising you to dress that way, ditch them üôÇSurplus to requirements. You and your music are astounding without all the ""frills"". I hope the music industry doesn't try to turn you into something they want you to be. Dan Reynolds, who's music I also love and who's music label you're signed up to, is a case in point. He's just comfortably and authentically himself whether he's hanging out, giving interviews, performing or recording music videos. When the artist is as good as you and the music is as phenomenal as yours you don't need any embellishment. Just the irrelevant opinion of someone who is grateful you found out you could sing and are now sharing your amazing talents with us. Thank you!",@sharyncamilleri3522,2025-02-23T11:36:46Z

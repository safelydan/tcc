Drake ruined this song no joke. Fr he did not catch this vibe or beat. He came on like “yo im drake this what I have to say this yo opportunity you don’t even have to pray just listen to me n get paid” type shit. Like bro went into full fake it mode. Cool he gave this artist a shot but this is a half hearted effort by drake who’s way better than this. His r&b flows on his older music destroy this shit he threw together. Get in your bag. Complacency destroys ambition. Just cause u made it doesn’t mean stop elevating.,@No_Zzzom,2024-03-14T18:08:22Z

"Drake went crazy on this beat, i genuinely fw it",@sourceeee,2024-03-08T17:31:57Z
Hope this young man doesn't get corrupted / watered down by the industry he has a very promising vibe that we need!! I seriously think hip hop needs to get back to days where a man rapped the verses and A soul try voice was on the hook! I.e is rule and Ashanti days!! We need that type of vibe back,@Lilbadtrinibih,2024-03-08T17:30:09Z
Drake verse is WEAK 😷,@InternetScammer,2024-03-08T16:45:15Z

"This shit go STUPID, I'm really fuckin' wit' the beat too!",@RahtheSunWorld,2024-03-08T11:27:47Z
Why drake always sing like this in this type of songs? he has a deep voice that sounds good and could have contrasted with 4batzs voice😭‼️🤓☝️,@frankitoooou,2024-03-08T10:06:23Z
I was mad when the beat switched knowing there's an R&B Drake coming 😂😂,@Jerkitf,2024-03-08T09:57:57Z
did this guy wake up from a 5 year coma or something? the high pitched voice gimmick hasn't been in for a minute now,@justas538,2024-03-08T09:55:07Z
Drake is everywhere it’s annoying,@ShotByKumoo,2024-03-08T09:33:34Z

That’s what we need drake that’s  late night vibes ❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥,@dariusjunior6429,2024-03-08T08:21:14Z
Would've been great if Drizzy stayed on the beat but I love the remix regardless,@shawnjay-zcarter3007,2024-03-08T08:03:41Z
"Only thing I don't like about drake's verse is that annoying auto tune in his voice, he can sing and has a very nice voice, he doesn't need this autotune, the remix is good though",@KennedyAlexandre247,2024-03-08T07:59:09Z
"Was wondering how Drake would fit on the beat, didn’t expect him to flow over the chopped and screwed but it was fire 🔥",@znffilthy7812,2024-03-08T07:40:44Z

Should’ve never slowed the beat down on Drake part 🔥 lemme cook someone need the make regular beat version on Drake part and I’ll have this on repeat 🔥 slowing up the beat and Drake verse slowed the vibe down didn’t like it but it’s still a good verse and good song regardless 🔥🤝,@RealClipz22,2024-03-08T06:46:29Z
"Been showing all my friends 4batz for the past 4 months, and now I’m gunna be that annoying dude telling everyone I was on this shit way before drake blew him up and everyone on it haha. But Idc im so hype drake hopped on this and killed it. Mans about to blow the fuck up !!!!",@chrisp6829,2024-03-08T06:44:31Z

This my ringtone and i love it!,@aklesiaaddixx7355,2024-03-08T05:19:44Z
"drake ruined it, soon as he started his verse the whole vibe changed and suddenly the song didn't  feel special anymore.",@pgrillamusic,2024-03-08T05:19:25Z
Sweeterman vibes,@user-kr1gi6ch9d,2024-03-08T05:19:13Z
Too much autotune on Drizzys vocals would be my only gripe but they handled the feature beautifully.,@patrick2099_,2024-03-08T05:16:14Z
I love the song and I LOVEEE drake verse. But Drake verse would’ve done better on a diffferent song. This one didn’t need to be touched.. it’s already a banger on its own.,@SereniityB,2024-03-08T05:15:31Z
"drake verse alright, could've hit a rythme/flow as Hotline bling.",@bevisjohn1446,2024-03-08T05:13:36Z
I expected better from this feature. The 2nd half of the verse was better. I'll probably stick to the original.,@SolShaman,2024-03-08T05:12:53Z
1:30 for Drake verse,@jmoney4220,2024-03-08T05:11:41Z
4batz and 4krarri very interesting that hey both got 4 in they name and do the high pitch thing 😑 it’s suspicious,@lostandfound6870,2024-03-08T05:07:48Z

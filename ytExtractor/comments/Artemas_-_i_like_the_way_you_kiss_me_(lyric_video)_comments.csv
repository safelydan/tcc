"It's a catchy track but the lyrics really bug me - he says ""not tryna to be romantic, I'll hit it from the back just so you don't get attached"", yet he also claims just before that ""I like the way you kiss me, I can tell you miss me""; the two statements are clearly contradictory. He doesn't want for her to get attached, yet he likes that he kisses her in a way which indicates she misses him i.e. actually is attached. The sum effect is to make the song sound insincere and confused.",@PhatInAHat,2024-11-11T17:04:41Z

"For those who have been in relationships like the one described in the lyrics, they know the range of feelings it evokes, whether it's euphoria, anguish, melancholy, regret, and a series of others. Listening to this song from that perspective adds tremendous depth. It is quite heartless to listen from a first-person point of view, but the one who is in love, even if deluded, leaves a small door of hope for humanity.",@HermanoCavalcante-t7o,2024-06-19T19:42:05Z

"This girl, again GIRL, is hitting what from the back? I am a little lost... This is something only a man could say but never would (unless there are some deviations at play), for the idea that mere sexual positions affect emotional connection is utterly ridiculous. She sounds like a virgin inventing things. I'll just say, the song is 1980s but the lyrics are pure 2020s, sadly.",@Electra-xm7lu,2024-04-10T14:07:02Z

"I remixed this track with similar perspective adding a burst of creative energy. Fully immersed in the essence of the music, I found myself drawn to the enduring charm of its basic harmonies and the steadfast reliability of its song structure. It's like rediscovering an old favorite with new eyes ‚Äì there's a sense of familiarity that brings comfort, yet there's also an exciting element of exploration as I delve deeper into its intricacies. With each beat and melody, I'm reminded of the timeless beauty inherent in simplicity, and the profound impact that tried-and-true methods can have on a listener's soul. In a world of constant change and innovation, there's something deeply reassuring about returning to the roots of what makes music truly captivating.",@KODIHARPER,2024-04-05T19:37:01Z

But this hit a little hard. It's just so heartless and reflects a lot of emotionally abusive//unavailable relationships of today.

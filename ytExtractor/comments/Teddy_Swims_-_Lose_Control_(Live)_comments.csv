The lyrics are the weakest part of the song.  His voice might be the best I ever heard . The guitar playing is  comparable to some of the all-time greats.. This is definitely a classic and probably one of the best songs I have ever heard.,@StephenPieck,2025-03-07T11:19:33Z
"I remember when I was listening to your covers of Mario “let me love you” “Tennessee Wisky” by Chris Stapleton, “Blinding Lights” by The Weekend. This was all 5 years ago and I knew that you would make it because you’re  Amazing and you would make it. I remember driving with my Wife across the country listening to your first album on repeat. And now your tickets at Red Rocks, Colorado are $1,000 plus just for GA. That’s ridiculous, I am disappointed that I am not in there financial position to pay for your tickets. I know all your lyrics to every song. We would love to see you, but I have to mention, sell out? Remember where you came from. You’ve taken fame too quickly my friend. Remember to stay humble and remember your roots. Hit me up if you read this message for some tickets. Your Adoring Fan.",@stephentodesco3788,2025-03-06T21:40:26Z

"Just want to leave this here, not all great guitar solos have to be technical. A large amount of the most memorable guitar solos just have good replayability and singability. For example, bohemian rhapsody, arguably the most famous guitar solo of all time, not very technical. The guitarist in this video did a great job, very tasteful and the tone was great.",@wisesteyes193,2025-02-12T04:54:40Z

"I am not sure if I am alright, really my emotions are all over the place one moment I am up the next i am down , sometimes i feel so empty as though there is a hole where my heart should be , just an emptiness inside me, but I tend to just say I am okay it is simpler that way nobody ever asks you to elaborate on being okay there are moments when everything feels confusing, days blend together and overthinking kills every happy moment. My mind races on to replay every moment every regret. I question whether it is all going to make sense someday if the ache will ease, right now it feels like i am lost, I look at the mirror and all I see is a stranger.",@edmondilbawi,2025-01-27T20:09:24Z

Annoying song and can’t stand it,@linpet99,2025-01-11T15:57:15Z
"My feeling is not envy. I really like Teddy's voice, but it's like complimenting someone for being beautiful. Beauty, voices like his or Adele's, are gifts of nature, not skills. I or anyone else, with an ordinary voice, can train as much as they want, but if the voice isn't beautiful, it doesn't become beautiful, and if the vocal range is what it is, it stays that way... That said, I give my congrats for the song",@relaxingmusic-xxx,2025-01-07T13:57:56Z

There’s sumn about this dude that’s pure. Genuine. He carried that sing and video “somethin bout a woman” as black ppl we can see when it’s faked. When the rhythm the persona is created. This dude is thorough. This really who he is and music is just the way he express him self. It’s refreshing to see sumn honest. Someone being themselves. And him being white with so much soul is insane I can’t lie. He had to have a big up bringing with black culture. Even if not. This is pure artistry. Gotta give props when they deserve it.,@Naledgetheartistofficial,2025-01-01T08:33:06Z

The damn emotions that sweep through and cut my soul deep when listening are a real testament to his singing and judging by the views I ain't the only one to think this either.

"It was a cold and chilly day. The streets were white it was snowing. I entered Best Buy and I knew I had arrived to my destination. Christmas was almost here so I went to buy a Christmas present. And approached checkout and as I was waiting on line to pay for the present something unexpectedly magical happened. This song was being played on the Best Buy speakers. The volume was low and would increase out of nowhere and it would go through the roof. It was being overplayed and I just had to see who was the legend playing this song. I laid my eyes across the store only to see the one and only legend playing it. He was tall like Alex, old like Frank and Indian like Daniel. I smiled inside my head and I was looking around to see if anyone heard this legend like I heard him. His talents were amazing that I started snapping my fingers and stomping my foot automatically to the beat. In my head I was like “TURN UP THE BEAT!!!” 🐶🎧I was still there waiting for my item to arrive when all of a sudden my spirit animal blessed my ears and nose. He had just tooted right in front of me no one else in sight had heard. I could smell what had had eaten a Taco Bell burrito with beans cheese and no sour cream made by jessica at 2:27 pm.

I could see a smile on his face and he curled up as close as he could to me and put his head on my shoulder and  gazed in my eyes. You touched his heart Teddy. It was the most amazing thing I have seen him do since my wife passed away 2 years ago.  My Bear is a 8yr old 135lb  Cane Corso and has always been a very emotional dog.

This song is literally written for me by this guy who seems to know how much I suffer when I’m alone without my husband in my life.  The lyrics about the devil is so true for me banging on my door to tell me to give up.  I am struggling with the fact that I’m older now and my body aches so bad that I just want to be out of pain.  Life has gotten worse over time and I feel compelled to give up on myself because I’m such a burden to my family that I just want to die and let them live in peace and seeing each other doing great things together.  God help us make it through this time.  😭😵‍💫,@Youtuber5775-,2024-11-11T05:15:33Z

The song coupled with his unbelievable voice touches places and emotions no song before ever has. And I'm 76 years old so I've heard a lot of great music in my time. Bravo, Mr. Sims.

"The devil is knocking on your door. Yikes. You want the ""full black magic"" - you got it. Just as pride is the way to destruction so is the embracement of evil. No need to lose control when someone who you want to be w/thinks otherwise. Just accept & move on - no blaming. No excuse to say that the person has created a ""mess"" in you. Reality - you did it to yourself. The Bible tells us not to put our trust in man. No illusion or delusion... we are to be of sound mind not preconceived notions. I like the music & this artists voice is incredible but the lyrics are laughable.  Somehow when a relationship ends its okay to blame & not take responsibility for one's actions that lead to the demise. Regardless.... lets just say moving on from a relationship is not the end of the world!!! 🤔",@aletafrances4984,2024-10-19T03:03:36Z

Holy crap. Who would've thought that it would be the floodgate to all things Teddy Swims ever since? I've gotten almost everything he's done so far, and I just can't turn it off. Seriously... no joke. On repeat. Everything. I heard an interview at C24, and it was cool to hear who he wanted to perform with: Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder and Adele!

"This is very cliche and generic. It's been done many times before.  Very uninspired.  He also has a medical problem with being real hairy.  Omg, and the out of tune guitar playing.  I think that was even worse than the singing.",@StephenMichael-r4e,2024-08-17T00:36:55Z
"I've just heard this song from my radio at work. It caught my attention and made me go down a bit of a rabbit hole. Starting from seeing the lyrics, then seeing shorts of free verse allowing others to show their vocals. Finally came to this video. Not since ""ordinary people"" have I appreciated just raw talent and only subtle lighting and camera movements to make an atmosphere.",@mysticmind4563,2024-08-16T18:52:38Z

"Awhile back my dentist gave me bottle of pills to help with the pain after he preformed a skin graft in my mouth. Long after my mouth got all fully healed I felt strange like I was becoming addicted to those pills, so I became bigger, stronger and stubborn to beat the addiction. I threw the bottle of pills away.",@leviackerman7514,2024-08-08T01:42:53Z

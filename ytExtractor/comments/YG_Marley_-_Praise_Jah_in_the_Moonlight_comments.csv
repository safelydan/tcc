"I really like the groove - the instrumentation is fantastic. But do NOT compare this to Bob Marley songs. I can barely hear any lyrics because of the mix. Beyond hearing the words ""fire"" and ""Jah"" this is NOT a song worthy of saying ""oh wow, the Marley gene carries on."" In other words, this is basic one drop-kick reggae that I'd expect to hear on the sail away deck party on a Carnival Cruise.",@YouKnowWhereYouWentWrong,2024-12-31T19:51:59Z

To all the souls saying this is just an ok song. You're either listener's or to be more kind hearers. I myself am a feeler as weƒ∫l as the other 2. And whilst music preference is subjective its still an artform and therfore there are objectively better combos of notes that will soothe the soul. As an example I dislike rock but am not so ignorant of it that I dont feel the good songs. I say good cos our language limits us. Queen can be used as a good example.  No album filling. Every song unique and distinct even haters recognise one of their songs lol. Now thats talent. Anyway im curving away. Long story short this song is beautifully designed and hits u in the feels. If u reply to me to disagree then youre proving me right. Love you all see u at the end,@shadak1ss,2024-09-30T09:18:29Z

Good song but he doesnt really say anything new or anything that rivals bobs triple meaning lyrics,@firefistx7477,2024-06-16T10:27:49Z
I dont like this song at all really. Everyone hyping it up like its the next Bob Marley i just dont see it. This song has no real meaning to it. Literally i only liked a few seconds early on. Im not hating on the dude he might have a great future but this is too hyped for no reason. Hes not the next Bob Marley. One it's a sample of bob marley and isn't original another thing is that he uses autotune and is not his true voice. True reggae artists don't rely on auto tune just pure talent and voice from the heart. He also isn't lyrical he relies one one liners and for half the song its just that. I need to see more actually speaking and showing me something that's not just one liners and sounds. It's a catchy song sure but it doesn't embody the style of a bob marley. I expect much better from him lyrically moving forward. Stop trying to force something and actually learn it and get used to it so it sounds natural.,@TheGamingShogun,2024-06-12T12:36:51Z

"JAH, YAHWEH and JEHOVAH are the same, the last two are valid translations of the name of God in Hebrew, and JAH is an abbreviation of the original name, and is not from the Rasta culture, it is a name that appears hundreds of times in the Bible, King David used it a lot in the book of Psalms when he composed songs for God, and the name Jehovah is one of the translations of God's name that is supported by Hebraists and is one of the best-known translations in the world. The only difference is that Rastas believe in reincarnation and Christians believe in resurrection, but it is the same JAH. JAH is the same God for everyone, he is the God of the universe, let's stop divisions. ‚ù§",@danelbonnet4808,2024-05-04T04:08:46Z

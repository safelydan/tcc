Beyond this just being such a well performed song on such a high level, with a beautiful 70s vibe that takes me back to a younger age.Probably everyone to hear this says this is how they want to fall so deeply in love with someone and we all desire that, and want to have that love that’s so worth fighting for.",@RobertGileski,2025-03-13T20:38:39Z

"Great song! The harmonies are banging and it’s good to see great voices singing together. My only concern is as someone who’s been in music for over 25 years, smoking is the worst thing to be doing to your voice. Like I get the aesthetic, but seriously, you can do some serious damage. It’s not good for breath control, the chemicals are bad for your voice, and it can cause harm. You both have very beautiful voices and I just don’t want to see cigarettes or whatever kill it. Not trying to be an anti smoking campaign, but please do not smoke.",@TheGreatEhumm,2025-03-08T22:43:03Z

"I think, at least from what I've heard and read from the lyrics. That this album is a concept album, and the story is about heart break, the way someone processes grief, realizing you gave it your all and finally, ""die with a smile"" acceptance in what has happened and or the future you've got with somebody and how important they are to you. Either if it isn't the way this album transforms from chaotic/synths n stuff to more calmer songs with less synths and more acoustic instruments.",@canon_glowsticks5392,2025-03-07T16:30:55Z

"My life passed away on Sep 26, 2024 - Cardiac arrest. He can't even hum - such an out of tune vocal. When he listened to this song on the first week of Sep, he commented this song is dedicated to you and he screamed terming as singing everytime looking at me and danced holding me . I made fun of him everytime about his out of pitch vocal and even told Alexa may be cursing you for playing this song on loop. Never in my dreams, I thought this is the last song I am going to hear in the name of singing and one of the fond memory I keep holding to drag my life without him.",@preethimathew3963,2025-03-07T08:30:54Z

Bruno Mars should sing this song alone or with a male backing vocalist. His voice is world class.,@monikayxyxyx7667,2025-03-06T23:05:09Z

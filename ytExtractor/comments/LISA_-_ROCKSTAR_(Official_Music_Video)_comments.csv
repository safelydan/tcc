"Hello! Can you react to Jimin's new single 'Smeraldo Garden Marching Band' feat LOCO? Jimin is a vocalist, member of BTS",@aliciadelgadomoreno1629,2024-07-01T22:28:36Z
"She is magnificent, Queen of Rokstar, a great vocalist, and an excellent dancer. I really like Lisa.",@filomenasantos2478,2024-06-30T10:41:51Z
Lyrics makes zero sense once again that's her taste she can't even write her song,@Crazypandaheheh,2024-06-29T23:30:54Z
"I can see reactors trying so hard to like the song to get validation from her fans. I get the disappointment of many. It's a grower song. You have to listen to it a few more times to even consider liking it. The lyrics are shallow, it doesn't have much to it. Music video killed it. I wish there was more choreography to it though.",@jackseptictank00,2024-06-29T16:11:46Z
This is awful. I‚Äôd rather stick steak knives in my ears. Are humans this stupid they like this???,@jasong.5165,2024-06-29T04:03:37Z
It's a grower song. You have to listen to it for a few times to like it. The lyrics are shallow as expected from Lisa. Music video killed it. I wish there was more choreo to it tho.,@jackseptictank00,2024-06-29T01:46:16Z
Wow 1M views in less than 24hrs for Reaction to the Queen of IMPACT!.üòÆ. You can never go wrong when making content of Miss Lalisa. She is so powerful yet she probably didn't know that she's helping many creators grow ‚ù§,@OrnersLee,2024-06-28T16:19:42Z
"The song is great, it suits her but I was expecting something diferent  idk‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs not that catchy as Money or Lalisa i would say",@cecile3690,2024-06-28T10:09:09Z
"She's a great performer, but the vocals just are not there for Miss lisa. It's so painfully autotuned & the beat is so boring. Hope she pulls it out with the next single.",@minion789,2024-06-28T09:42:47Z
Bro we got the same exact reactions during the chorus part üòÇ‚ù§,@adysyady5527,2024-06-28T07:06:41Z
It's not even a good song. It's better if she just let Teddy produce her songs cus this feels empty and the lyrics are horrible,@papabear7116,2024-06-28T06:21:49Z
No Anyone beat our Lisa üòÆ,@RaunakHashmi-qw8jc,2024-06-28T06:09:21Z
"Lisa sampled another artist song and another ones choreography. It a shame and the song is full of autotune, noise and cringe lyrics",@MaryOsei-s5u,2024-06-28T04:07:51Z
"Now she can freely write her own verse, I'm so happy for her",@Vee_nazzWashington,2024-06-28T02:36:06Z
"This production is incredible, the music, lyrics, beat, the camera game, the dancers etc are all insane",@Cavalo_17,2024-06-28T02:05:55Z
"Todo estuvo perfecto, los vocales, el rap, la coreograf√≠a, los vestuariosüî•‚ù§Ô∏è qu√© calidad",@KasandraHernandez-ii3wn,2024-06-28T01:59:55Z
I don‚Äôt like it. It sounds zero repetitive. I was expecting so much more.,@cam857,2024-06-28T01:56:46Z
"The rap, visuals, dance, vocals are so sick even the back up dancers, the big bikers! the amazing set locations, This is INSANE! SHE KILLED IT!",@ManuelSison-s6j,2024-06-28T01:22:49Z
Lisa is one of the most powerful woman I‚Äôve ever laid my eyes on since day one. Even after all of the things she‚Äôs been through. She is TRUELY a rockstar!!,@dr4amer,2024-06-28T01:22:42Z
what makes this even better is how she participated in composition and writing the lyrics!,@The_Real_Yang_Injang,2024-06-28T01:14:29Z
She really devoured this time. The only issue here the song is too short. But everything in her comeback is so catchy.üòä,@neth3712,2024-06-28T01:10:27Z

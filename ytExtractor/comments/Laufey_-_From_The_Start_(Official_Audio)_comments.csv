"I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Cat dancing has changed my life for the better.

I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could a cat do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the cat dances, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42. I am crying. This has made me go through an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you.",@Xxyour_MommyxX,2023-07-30T11:46:11Z

"I love music that sounds from the heart. I don't mean deep mysterious lyrics that no one but the artist understands, or when it's so sad that you're crying with the singer. I love music that may be a common happening and extremely non-unique, but you make it unique to you. Having a crush on a friend and them not liking you back is something that has happened to me too many times to count, but I don't entirely relate to this song because this isn't mine, it's Laufeys. That's what is so special. If I wrote this song (it wouldn't be nearly as good because I don't make music) but it would be in a completely different tone. It would be chaotic and noisy, with old-timey wording or confusing references because that's who I am. This song is upbeat, jazzy, and elegant with a side of playfulness, love, and melancholy and all of its beauty because that's who she is. This situation may have happened a million times, and there might have been a million songs written about it, but it doesn't make this one any less good because this is her song.",@blued0rito194,2023-06-23T14:28:18Z

"this song is simply amazing, her voice is truly so touching. its smooth, its clear, it can express emotions so well. i also connect to this song so much it has the vibe of ""its hard to let you go but i shouldn't let this get to my head"" this is just an description of me and my guy friend's relationship, i liked him and he knew since i made it a bit obvious but turns out he actually liked my best friend and now we talk less and we're more awkward around each other, lots of the time it gets to my head making me feel like im not good enough for anyone but this song strongly represents that letting go of someone doesn't always have to be a sad thing and this time i've tried my best to be mature about the situation. this is an amazing song, i love what you're doing :)",@enmxi,2023-05-19T12:57:23Z
"It's probably commonplace, but Laufey finds the precise words to describe this feeling (of which I feel part of right now). Your incredible voice and Bossa Nova rhythm ... thank you for continuing to make music 😌",@72_a,2023-05-16T21:43:07Z
"I love this entire song to bits—it’s a sway-in-my-room, all-is-well kind of song—but what REALLY gets me with this release is your voice, specifically right at the end. On my first listen I just kept replaying that little ending piece over and over again—your voice is so sweet and gentle, and you somehow managed to put so much raw YEARNING into those final notes that it brought tears to my eyes (and still does, dozens of listens later!). Those last few seconds packed to the brim with emotion really are my favorite part of the song.",@lightavii,2023-05-15T03:45:00Z

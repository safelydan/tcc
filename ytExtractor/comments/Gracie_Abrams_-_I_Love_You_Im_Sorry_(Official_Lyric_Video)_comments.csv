Lyrics make no sense just put strings of random word together,@crackh0e942,2024-12-22T05:58:02Z
"This is a really random rant, but I just feel like I have to say it. So, I'm a girl, but my first love was a girl. A little while ago, I finally got over her after about 2-3 years, but looking back at our relationship, I don't even know if any of it was real. I know I loved her, I really did, but sometimes I doubt whether or not she loved me and I start to think maybe she just loved the feeling of being loved and that was why she accepted me. These thoughts are what cause me to doubt my so-called ""first love."" And that all leads to me believing that maybe I've never truly experienced real love before. It makes me often think, as well, that maybe I am incapable of being loved. And it eats away at me. Anytime I think I may like someone or am attracted to them, I always, always question whether or not I truly love them or whether it's just limerence, or infatuation, and that drives me absolutely crazy. I usually move on quickly after not seeing them for a while unless we had an actual relationship, no matter the kind, romantic or platonic (it is usually the latter). But I also continue to think of them. I'm not sure if my mind is just curious while my heart is simultaneously yearning, and I know I desire to be loved the way I love others, maybe even deeper, but I feel like I never have been loved, not even by family, and definitely not even by myself. I just feel so incapable of being loved. So unfortunately, I feel like I resonate with this song so much. It may not mean exactly how I interpret it, but I love these types of ambiguous songs. I think I could also intepret this song in a way where I could put myself in the place of the singer. ""I love you, I'm sorry."" I am not capable of being loved. But if I have never been loved before, then how do I know to love so well? How do I know the difference between love and obsession? Love and limerence? Love and infatuation? Love and lust? Love and attraction? Love and desire? Love and greed? Love and longing? Or maybe I just crave love. So I give it all out until there is none left for myself. And now I am left as a hopeless, lonely individual who does not love themself. Someone who can't tell whether or not they truly love someone or are truly loved. Someone who cannot tell the distinction between anything, and someone who does not know what it feels like to be able to let go. Thank you for this song. In conclusion, if you feel similar to me, I'm being typical, but, I love you. You deserve the world. And this message in itself, and ending in itself, are telling me that I truly need to learn to love myself. I love you, I love you. I'm sorry.",@kms-f6q,2024-10-18T08:24:01Z

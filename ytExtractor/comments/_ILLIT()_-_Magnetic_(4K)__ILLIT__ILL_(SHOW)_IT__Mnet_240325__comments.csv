"The more i see wonhee, she reminds me of the actress park han byul 박한별. Minju reminds me of shinee minho 민호. Yunha reminds me of tara hyomin 효민. Moka is like the smiley version of the actress jung somin (imay need to revisit this 1). iRoha has similar faces of many but it's hard to pick just one. To me, her eyes and mostly vibe reminds me of lisa bonet when she played the charcter denise. The girls, ILLIT are incredibly talented. This song is so catchy 😀",@winterso8589,2024-04-29T03:17:01Z

It's all fake. The encore disaster is the proof they have horrible vocals live. Fans should open their eyes and stop supporting fake and edited music. Let's save KPOP again from dying.,@BokBokbok-sr3zo,2024-04-03T17:40:10Z

The vocal idk this gen of kpop are all about lip syncing and dancing and more sound effects rather than singing. Anyone can be an idol nowadays as long as they have the face.. I miss SNSD and 2ne1. Tbh Newjeans actually have better vocal than them.,@MsLacieable,2024-03-26T08:34:51Z

NEW JEANS VIBES😢,@trinachoi,2024-03-26T03:05:52Z
"I really hope this group sings live, without autotune. I went to see NewJeans and Lesserafim, total disappointment, the supporting voices are heard more than their real voices, get in the front row, take off that they are pretty and that you have some ballet flats, I'm sorry but I spent my money in vain and if it's annoying. Hybe boy groups, on the other hand, do sing live and those who have been to Bts concerts and more can attest to this. Hybe will one day form a singing girl group. I hope so. For now I will only support BTS. Until there actually is a group of girls on Hybe who are singers, not just pretty faces.",@nobudaiki,2024-03-26T02:58:08Z

"UGH Love the concept, styling, and vibe. They are able to play on the magical/etheral vibes that the only Hybe GG's don't have. Very reminiscent of TXT IMO.would love them to see them do a similar concept to Enhypen since they are their sister group. Regarding the NJ similarities, like another Redditter has said before, ILLIT focuses on the more hyperpop and anime like sound while NJ only used this sound like once or twice. IMO it this song has ""Get up"" vibes but that's it. I think it just sucks that HYBE released another 5 member group (even though it was 6, but easily could've done 7) and only had 6 considering the amount of talent we saw in RUNext. I cant wait to see more releases from and I hope they can stick with this sound - kinda like the aim high and scrum vibes :)",@KPOPTrashLyrics,2024-03-25T20:46:52Z

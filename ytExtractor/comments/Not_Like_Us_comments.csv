I love coming back to run through these tracks of Kenny's Diss EP because Drake only makes these lyrics shine brighter and brighter every time he does some goofy s*** because he done spiraled all the way down to the Home For Infinite Losers SMH,@kynshii,2025-03-19T23:44:05Z

"What I never noticed until recently, the song he samples and the particular portion of song has lyrics that says “I believe it, I believe it!”. So it’s almost as if the piano is singing “I believe it” in the background throughout the song further affirming any validity in the lyrics.

"As witty as the line ""Tryna strike a chord and it's probably a minor"" is, the most genius part of this song in my opinion is how he draws a parallel between the history of Atlanta being built on slave labor and Drake exploiting Black rappers from the Atlanta scene for his own benefit. Then to end that verse with ""It was God's plan to show y'all the liar."" Remarkable.",@PunkRockProfessor1996,2024-12-08T03:00:35Z

Anything from G-unit during the JaRule beef and Eminem has numerous diss tracks that far surpass this travesty of a song. Shit Dre Day was a much better diss track.

"Lyrics…
In Penny Lane, there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
And little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Wet beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back in
Penny Lane, there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine
Penny Lane, is in my ears and in my eyes
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway
Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then, the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane

"In Penny Lane, there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
And little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Wet beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back in
Penny Lane, there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine
Penny Lane, is in my ears and in my eyes
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway
Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then, the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies

What a perfect example for all peoples of being a kid on the inside, always.

He’s just very innocuous & has great positive energy & influence on all always.

The Beatles  ---  “  Penny Lane  ”（  1967  ）  The Lyrics

Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say "" Hello "".

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
And little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back in

In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass,
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
It's a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer. Meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray.
And though she feels as if she's in a play, she is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim,
And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain
very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane 
..
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Beatles  ---  “ 佩妮街道（ 利物浦的一条街 ） ”   (  1967 年  )  歌词

佩妮街道有个理发师在展示他的照片
他有幸认识的每一个人。
所有来来去去的人
停下来，说 “ 你好 ”。

街角有个开着汽车的银行家，
还有小孩子们在背后嘲笑他。
银行家从来不穿雨衣
在瓢泼大雨中，很奇怪。

佩妮街道在我的耳朵和眼睛里。
在郊区蔚蓝的天空下
我坐着，同时向后退去

在佩妮街道有一个拿着沙漏的消防员，
在他的口袋里有一幅女王的画像。
他喜欢保持消防车的清洁，
这是一台保持消防车的清洁干净的机器。

佩妮街道在我的耳朵和眼睛里。
四份鱼和手指派甜馅饼
在夏天。与此同时回来

在环岛中间的掩体后面
漂亮的护士在用托盘卖罂粟花。
虽然无论如何她觉得自己像是在演戏。

在佩妮街道，理发师给另一位顾客刮脸，
我们看到银行家坐在那里等着理发，
然后消防员冲了进来
从瓢泼大雨中逃出来，真奇怪。

佩妮街道在我的耳朵和眼睛里。
在郊区蔚蓝的天空下
我坐着，同时向后退去。

佩妮街道在我的耳朵和眼睛里。
在郊区蔚蓝的天空下
佩妮 街道 !

I was a militant atheist for years and later dabbled in the occult. I never imagined I would be a Christian. I hated the religion. However, I had a supernatural encounter with Jesus that completely changed me and my life.

Nothing this world can offer you even compares to knowing Jesus. His peace, love, and joy transcends all.

"Em Penny Lane, há um barbeiro mostrando fotos
In Penny Lane, there is a barber showing photographs

De cada cabeça que ele teve o prazer de conhecer
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know

E todas as pessoas que vêm e vão
And all the people that come and go

Pare e diga olá
Stop and say hello

Na esquina está um banqueiro com um automóvel
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar

E as crianças riem dele pelas costas
And little children laugh at him behind his back

E o banqueiro nunca usa um mac na chuva torrencial
And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain

Muito estranho
Very strange

Penny Lane está nos meus ouvidos e nos meus olhos
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes

Molhado sob o céu azul suburbano
Wet beneath the blue suburban skies

Eu sento e enquanto isso volto
I sit and meanwhile back in

Penny Lane, há um bombeiro com uma ampulheta
Penny Lane, there is a fireman with an hourglass

E no bolso dele está um retrato da Rainha
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen

Ele gosta de manter seu carro de bombeiros limpo
He likes to keep his fire engine clean

É uma máquina limpa
It's a clean machine

Penny Lane, está nos meus ouvidos e nos meus olhos
Penny Lane, is in my ears and in my eyes

Um quatro de peixe e tortas
A four of fish and finger pies

No verão, enquanto isso de volta
In summer, meanwhile back

Atrás do abrigo no meio de uma rotunda
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout

Uma enfermeira bonita está vendendo papoulas em uma bandeja
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray

E embora ela sinta como se estivesse em uma peça
And though she feels as if she's in a play

Ela é de qualquer maneira
She is anyway

Penny Lane, o barbeiro faz a barba de outro cliente
Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer

Vemos o banqueiro sentado esperando um corte
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim

E então, o bombeiro corre da chuva torrencial
And then, the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain

Muito estranho
Very strange

Penny Lane está nos meus ouvidos e nos meus olhos
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes

Lá sob o céu azul suburbano
There beneath the blue suburban skies

Eu sento e enquanto isso volto
I sit and meanwhile back

Penny Lane está nos meus ouvidos e nos meus olhos
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes

Lá sob o céu azul suburbano
There beneath the blue suburban skies

"THE RUTLES :

     "" DOUBLEBACK ALLEY. ""

( Dirk McQuickly - Ron Nasty. )

Lead Vocal : DIRK McQUICKLY.

( G ) ( P ) December / 1966.

People were proud in Doubleback
                                                 Alley
neighbors were loud but ever
                                            so pally.
People would shout,
joking about.
The smoke and the soot,
mother would put.
The milk bottles out.

We had a good time in 
                            Doubleback Alley
with fences to climb and Father
                                        O'Malley.
To clip your ear and steer you
                                               clear
of the funny man in the ice cream
                                                    van
who talked so queer.

Doubleback Alley takes me back
and in my mind I see.
Happy smiling faces if I flog my
                                             memory.

Plenty to do in Doubleback Alley
play peek - a - boo with 
                          Saccharine Sally.
Bouncing a ball against a wall
showing her draw,
you come indoors.
Her dad would call.

Doubleback Alley takes me back
and in my mind I see.
Happy smiling faces if I flog 
                                      my memory.

Stinking of gin in Doubleback Alley
grinning a grin in Doubleback Alley.
Kick a dustbin, bingo to win.
Windows to break,
mother would take.
The milk bottles in.

Doubleback Alley takes me back
and in my mind I see.
Happy smiling faces if I flog 
                                         my memory.

Doubleback Alley takes me back
and in my mind I see.
Happy smiling faces if I flog 
                                      my memory.


    DOUBLEBACK ALLEY !!!!

"Please To Listen :

         The Original Song :

                THE RUTLES :

             "" BENNY LANE. ""

( Dirk McQuickly -- Ron Nasty. )

Lead Vocal : DIRK McQUICKLY.

( G ) ( P ) December / 1966.

I will tell about
the favorite place :
Benny Lane, a nice place.
I was sorry very good
even said : "" Hello ! ""

    The impeccable Traffic Guard
     observes everything around you.
    He knows it is well better
     than is the his duty.

Benny Lane is a better place
with peace and tranquility.
Our senses show reality.

   The merchant opens your store
    features several of your 
                                        products.
    The barber looks at your image
    and your image is clean.

                  ( Solo. )

Benny Lane is the place that I saw.
The emotions grow in me
when I am on here.

   The flowers appeared on 
                                       the counter
    the perfumes arrive through
                                         the air.
    The florist smiles at the
                                     pedestrians
     as they pass.

The young student
that came from school.
Walking the sidewalk
without delay.
But the rain comes suddenly
and it's gone surprisingly.

  Benny Lane is so dear place.
  Ah! If I could I wanted
  to stay forever.

Benny Lane is the moment
of mine senses.
It's a songs by lived
well matched.

            BENNY LANE !!!!

"Interesting how Paul almost puts the bass handed to him in the right hand playing position, neck moving to his left. He started the move. It wasn’t momentum from being handed it. Then he smartly reverses course and goes neck to the right, like a lefty automatically would.

"Robert Johnsons started it, but you can hear it in Liverpuddlian accents; nowhere on earth sucks worse than that place.  The Beatles wanted to get way out of there.  Haha, they learned what to do in a German club;  if they turn blues into party music, the girls will like it!
On Penny Lane, it's just like an opera.  They know they have to go with the great classical composers, too.  Someone hands Paul his bass, and he doesn't know what to do with it.  John thinks it's good, but someone smart is going to come along and do it better...
Good ol' Ringo thinks, ""Oh yeah, your drummer left for the German photo artist's reason, right as she was about to make you huge?  Yeah, sure, I know how to just do it like that.""",[],@HisHonorable,2023-10-13T13:07:33Z

"DESTROY THE BEATLES
I readily admit it, my brothers.  I have tried to destroy The Beatles.  Yes, my brothers, for decades I have tried to destroy them.  Sleepless nights.  Months spent reading through the world's great libraries. Thousands of plans drawn up on blueprint paper.  I have consulted with the finest minds in the universe, finally assembling a small team from the most brilliant among them.  For seven years we lived in a bunker constructed under the Atlantic Ocean, focused on one goal: DESTROY THE BEATLES.  Meetings.  Deadlines.  Screaming matches.  Threats of having them ejected into the dark and dour ocean.  But now I admit defeat, my brothers.  It cannot be done.  The Beatles cannot be destroyed.  They are eternal, and their music shall cover the Earth like an eternal blanket of beauty.  It shall drift through the solar system like a gentle blessing, past the milky way and into the cosmos, finally uniting with the essence of existence, pulsing through every atom in the universe, the rhythm of their music a vast eternal heartbeat in the fabric of creation...forever.","['In other words their songs are bomb proof!

"❤❤❤Deuteronomy 6

New International Version

Love the Lord Your God

6 These are the commands, decrees and laws the Lord your God directed me to teach you to observe in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess, 2 so that you, your children and their children after them may fear the Lord your God as long as you live by keeping all his decrees and commands that I give you, and so that you may enjoy long life. 3 Hear, Israel, and be careful to obey so that it may go well with you and that you may increase greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, promised you.

4 Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.[a] 5 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. 6 These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts. 7 Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. 8 Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. 9 Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates.

10 When the Lord your God brings you into the land he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give you—a land with large, flourishing cities you did not build, 11 houses filled with all kinds of good things you did not provide, wells you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves you did not plant—then when you eat and are satisfied, 12 be careful that you do not forget the Lord, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.

13 Fear the Lord your God, serve him only and take your oaths in his name. 14 Do not follow other gods, the gods of the peoples around you; 15 for the Lord your God, who is among you, is a jealous God and his anger will burn against you, and he will destroy you from the face of the land. 16 Do not put the Lord your God to the test as you did at Massah. 17 Be sure to keep the commands of the Lord your God and the stipulations and decrees he has given you. 18 Do what is right and good in the Lord’s sight, so that it may go well with you and you may go in and take over the good land the Lord promised on oath to your ancestors, 19 thrusting out all your enemies before you, as the Lord said.",[],@larrychuchua6287,2023-07-13T12:18:53Z

"❤❤❤James 1
New International Version
1 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,

To the twelve tribes scattered among the nations:

Greetings.

Trials and Temptations
2 Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters,[a] whenever you face trials of many kinds, 3 because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. 4 Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything. 5 If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you. 6 But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. 7 That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord. 8 Such a person is double-minded and unstable in all they do.

9 Believers in humble circumstances ought to take pride in their high position. 10 But the rich should take pride in their humiliation—since they will pass away like a wild flower. 11 For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant; its blossom falls and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way, the rich will fade away even while they go about their business.

12 Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him.

13 When tempted, no one should say, “God is tempting me.” For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; 14 but each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed. 15 Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.

16 Don’t be deceived, my dear brothers and sisters. 17 Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows. 18 He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created.",[],@larrychuchua6287,2023-07-02T00:52:40Z

"Was on Penny Lane recently. Barbershop is still there. Also the church where Paul and his brother sang in the choir. The church has a graveyard that includes the final resting place of one ""Eleanor Rigby,"" who was interned there in 1939 (age 44). McCartney undoubtedly passed the tombstone many times on his way to choir practice, but has no memory of having ever seen it. There's no ""roundabout"" on Penny Lane any more.

"Penny Lane, there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say, ""Hello""
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
And little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a Mac in the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Wet beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back in
Penny Lane, there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine
Penny Lane, is in my ears and in my eyes
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway
Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then, the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
